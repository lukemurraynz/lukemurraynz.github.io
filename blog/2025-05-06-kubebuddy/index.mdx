The tag line of KubeBuddy is:

> Kubernetes says your cluster is healthy. It’s probably not.

## Overview

Developed by Microsoft Azure MVP, Richard Hooper - let us take a look at KubeBuddy against an Azure Kubernetes Cluster _(AKS)_.

:::info
[KubeBuddy](https://kubebuddy.kubedeck.io/) powered by [Kubedeck](https://github.com/kubedeckio) is a comprehensive diagnostic tool designed to address the hidden issues within Kubernetes clusters. It aims to solve problems related to node failures, pod crashes, security risks, and networking issues. By running externally via your terminal or Docker, KubeBuddy ensures no cluster intrusion, providing clean execution without agents or Helm charts. It generates actionable reports in HTML, JSON, or CLI formats, offering quick insights and sharing capabilities. KubeBuddy's stateless design means scans don't persist anything, ensuring no runtime footprint or security baggage. It can be used locally, in CI/CD, or on a jump host, making it versatile for various work environments.

Today, we are going to run it locally, against an AKS cluster - using PowerShell. If you are so inclined you can go down the [docker](https://kubebuddy.kubedeck.io/usage/docker-usage/) route.
