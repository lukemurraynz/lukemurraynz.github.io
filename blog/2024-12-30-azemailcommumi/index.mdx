[Azure Communication Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/communication-services?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) brings rich communication APIs to all of your apps across any device on any platform, using the same reliable and secure infrastructure that powers Microsoft Teams.

Today, we will explore using Email as part of Azure Communication Services, using the REST API and PowerShell to send an email using a User Assigned Managed Identity.

:::info
I did a previous article: [Deploying and Testing Azure Email Communication Services](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/using-communication-services-and-powershell-to-send-emails/) on this, however the authentication was using an Azure Service Principal. A reader reached out to me about using a User Assigned Managed identity, so I have tested and updated the script to use a User Assigned Managed Identity.
:::

In this example, I will access a token from [Azure Communication Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/communication-services?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796). I will make a GET request to the identity endpoint of Azure Communication Services, using the oauth identity from the user assigned-managed identity. This will return a token we can use to authenticate against the REST API.

You will need the ClientId of the User Assigned Managed Identity, and that ClientId needs to have Contributor rights to the Azure Communication Service _(not Email or Domain service)_.

![User Assigned Managed Identity](images/UIMClientID.png)

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the script:

The script accepts several parameters and constructs an email message in HTML format. It then authenticates using Azure Managed Identity to obtain an access token, which is used to authorize the email sending request to Azure Communication Services.

The script defines the following parameters:

* ClientId: The Client ID for User Assigned Managed Identity (optional).
* EmailRecipient: The recipient's email address.
* SenderAddress: The sender's email address.
* ResourceID: The resource ID for Azure Communication Services.
* CommunicationEndpointUrl: The endpoint URL for Azure Communication Services.

1. The script checks if a Client ID is provided. If so, it constructs a URI to obtain an access token using User Assigned Managed Identity. Otherwise, it uses System Assigned Managed Identity.
2. The script then makes a GET request to the identity endpoint to retrieve the access token.
3. The script constructs the URI for the email sending endpoint and defines the headers, including the access token.
4. A function Send-Email is defined to send the email using the Invoke-RestMethod cmdlet.
5. The email content and recipient details are defined in a hashtable, which is passed to the Send-Email function.

_(This authenticaiton was inititally written to be used in a Azure Automation Runbook, with the User Managed Identity assigned Contributor rights to the Azure Communication Services resource (not the Email Communication Services).)_

Here is the PowerShell script to send an email using Azure Communication Services using the [User Managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) of an [Azure Automation account](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/automation/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796):

You can run this script in an Azure Automation Runbook _(and theoretically in an [Azure Function](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) as well)_ to send an email using Azure Communication Services with a User Assigned Managed Identity.
