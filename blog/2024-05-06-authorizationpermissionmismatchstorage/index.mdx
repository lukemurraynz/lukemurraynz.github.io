When attempting to copy files in an Azure DevOps pipeline, to an Azure Storage account, I received the following error:

:::warning
##[error]Upload to container: 'StorageContainer' in storage account: 'ContosoStorageAccount' with blob prefix: '736' failed with error: 'AzCopy.exe exited with non-zero exit code while uploading files to blob storage.' For more info please refer to [https://aka.ms/azurefilecopyreadme](https://aka.ms/azurefilecopyreadme).

After reviewing the Azure DevOps raw pipeline logs I noticed the following:

:::warning

2024-05-06T06:25:34.1052461Z RESPONSE 403: 403 This request is not authorized to perform this operation using this permission.

> **The fix, was to make sure that the Service Prinicpal that Azure DevOps is using to read/write to the Azure Storage account, has the correct permissions. In my case, I needed to assign the [Storage Blob Data Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#storage) role to the Service Principal.**
