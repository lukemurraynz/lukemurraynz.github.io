Aggregate or Slice: APIs can aggregate data from multiple sources or slice it into meaningful pieces for specific use cases. This flexibility allows businesses to present data in the most relevant and valuable way to their users.
Normalize or Modernize: Façade Abstraction also helps normalize or modernize legacy systems, making them compatible with modern applications. This allows you to extend the life of older systems and integrate them with new technologies without extensive rework.
Decouple Lifecycle Mock: Decoupling the API lifecycle from the backend systems ensures that changes in backend services do not disrupt the API functionality. Mocking services during the development and testing phases further ensures smooth transitions and updates.
- **Front Door Control**
This aspect is about managing and controlling how APIs are accessed and utilized.
Route and Accelerate: By routing API requests efficiently, you can optimize your applications' performance and responsiveness. Acceleration techniques like caching and load balancing can significantly improve user experience.
Secure and Protect: Security is paramount in API management. Front Door Control involves implementing robust security measures to protect APIs from threats and unauthorized access. These measures include authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
Transform and Observe: Transforming API requests and responses to meet specific requirements and observing API usage patterns helps maintain control and ensure optimal performance. Monitoring tools provide insights into how APIs are being used and can alert you to potential issues before they become critical.
- **Frictionless Consumption**
This principle is about making it easy for developers and users to discover, access, and use your APIs.
Onboarding: A smooth onboarding process is crucial for attracting and retaining users. Clear documentation, tutorials, and support help users quickly understand and start using your APIs.
Discover and Learn: APIs should be easily discoverable. A well-organized developer portal where users can learn about the available APIs, their functionalities, and use cases can achieve this.
Try and Obtain Access: Allowing users to try APIs in a sandbox environment and easily obtain access through streamlined registration encourages experimentation and adoption.

### Design

![API Lifecycle - Design](images/apim_apilifecyle_design.PNG)

Code-and design-first approaches to building APIs

API Management supports both approaches to building APIs: 

- **Code-first approach**
Implement the API and generate the API specification as an afterthought (i.e., with Swashbuckle). Benefits: 
More convenient for API developers: The only option for existing APIs

- **Design-first approach**
Create an API specification, review it with stakeholders, and implement the API Kickstart development by scaffolding the code from the API specification. 

Benefits: 

Better API consumer experience thanks to the deliberate API design Reduced risk thanks to the API review processes
