In addition to the Azure portal, you can also leverage the Visual Studio Code extension. This extension integrates seamlessly with Azure, allowing you to manage and define your APIs directly within your development environment. It's an excellent tool for developers who prefer to work locally.

Testing the API:

Once the API is defined, the next crucial step is testing. Azure simplifies this process in several ways:

Azure Portal Testing:
You can test your API directly within the Azure portal. This feature lets you ensure everything functions correctly without switching between multiple tools.
Schema Generation:
Azure can generate schemas from your API responses. These schemas provide a clear structure of your API's data, ensuring that both developers and consumers understand the expected input and output formats.

![APIM - Mock API](images/apim_apilifecyle_design_mockapi.PNG)

Adopting a design-first approach can significantly enhance efficiency and collaboration. One technique we can utilize is mocking the API. Let's explore how this approach can benefit our development workflow.

Design-First Approach - Mock the API:

1. Unblock Front-End Teams:

Mocking API responses is a game-changer for front-end developers.
Providing predefined responses enables front-end teams to continue their development work without waiting for the back-end to be fully implemented.
This leads to parallel development, reducing bottlenecks and speeding up the overall project timeline.

2. Use an Example Defined in the API Definition:

The process starts with defining an example response within the API definition.
This predefined response acts as a placeholder, simulating the actual API behavior.
It ensures that front-end teams have consistent and reliable data to work with during the early stages of development.
3. Configure with a Single-Line Policy:

One of Azure API Management's standout features is the ability to configure mocking with a simple, single-line policy.

As shown in the example on the image, the policy can be written as:

```xml
<inbound>
  <base />
  <mock-response status-code="200" content-type="application/json" />
</inbound>
```

![APIM - Mock Design](images/apim_apilifecyle_design_apimock.gif)

This configuration tells the API to return a mock response with a status code of 200 and a content type of application/json.

![APIM - Websocket](images/apim_apilifecyle_design_websocket.PNG)

[WebSocket API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/websocket-api?tabs=portal&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) support enables real-time communication, making our APIs more dynamic and responsive.

[WebSocket API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/websocket-api?tabs=portal&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) support in Azure API Management opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for real-time applications. Let's delve into what this entails and how it can benefit our API infrastructure.

Passthrough Support for WebSocket APIs:

![APIM - Cross Domain policies](images/apim_apilifecyle_design_crossdomainpolicy.PNG)

Policy Scopes

![APIM - Policy Scopes](images/apim_apilifecyle_design_policyscopes.PNG)

Let's examine the policy scopes. Understanding the scope is crucial to applying the right policy in the right place. Policies are inherited from the parent scope to the child scope.

So let us go through them.

* Global _(Red Border)_

Description: Global policies apply to all requests and responses passing through the API Management instance. They are the outermost scope, impacting every operation, API, and product.
Usage: Commonly used for policies like CORS _(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)_ and logging, which should be consistent across the entire API Management instance.

* Workspace _(Yellow Border)_

Description: This scope is associated with a workspace, which groups related APIs and other components within API Management.
Usage: Policies defined at this level are used when consistent policy enforcement is needed across multiple APIs belonging to the same workspace.

* Product _(Green Border)_

Description: Product-level policies apply to all APIs included within a specific product. Products are a way to bundle APIs together for subscription and access management.
Usage: Common for setting rate limits and quotas that apply to all APIs in the product, helping to manage usage and prevent abuse.

* API _(Blue Border)_

Description: API-level policies apply to all operations within a specific API. This scope allows for API-wide behavior customization.
Usage: Often used for API-specific security measures like JWT (JSON Web Token) validation or other API-wide configurations.

* Operation _(Purple Border)_

Description: Operation-level policies are the most granular and apply to a specific operation within an API _(e.g., a single endpoint or method)_.
Usage: Useful for operation-specific requirements like caching, URL rewriting, or request/response transformation.

* Inbound and Outbound policies

Inbound policies are applied as the request comes in from the caller, and outbound policies are applied as the response is sent back to the caller after being processed by the backend.

Each of these scopes allows for different levels of customization and control over how requests and responses are handled within Azure API Management.

If we take a look at the [policy named values](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-properties?tabs=azure-portal&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and [expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-policy-expressions?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).

![APIM - Policy Values](images/apim_apilifecyle_design_policysvalues.PNG)

We can see that Named Values are a powerful feature in Azure API Management that allows us to define reusable variables and secrets that can be used across policies.

> Policies are a collection of statements that are executed sequentially on the request or response of an API. Policy statements can be constructed using literal text values, policy expressions, and named values.

Named values are a global collection of name/value pairs in each API Management instance. There is no imposed limit on the number of items in the collection. Named values can be used to manage constant string values and secrets across all API configurations and policies.

Lets take a look at some out of the box policies

![APIM - Out of the box policies](images/apim_apilifecyle_design_outoftheboxpolicies.PNG)

Azure API Management includes, "Out of the box policies" provides the majority of use cases that that can be implemented to manage access, transform data, advance functionalities, integrate with Dapr, authenticate users, cache data, manage cross-domain calls, and validate information. 

Let us delve into each category to understand the capabilities these policies offer.

* **Access Restriction**

Access restriction policies are crucial for controlling who can access your services and how often. These policies include:

Check HTTP header: Validates headers in HTTP requests.
Limit call rate by subscription/key: Controls the rate of API calls based on the subscription or key.

Send request to a service / message to a pub/subtopic: Facilitates interaction with Dapr services and pub/subtopics.
Trigger output binding: Initiates output bindings in Dapr.

* **Authentication**

Authentication policies ensure that only authorized users can access your services:

Authenticate with basic / client certificate / managed identity: Supports various authentication methods to verify user identity.

* **Caching**

Caching policies improve performance by storing and retrieving data from the cache:

Store to cache / Get value from cache / Store value from cache / Remove value from cache: Manages caching operations to optimize data retrieval.

* **Cross Domain**
Cross-domain policies handle calls across different domains:

CORS / JSON: Manages cross-origin resource sharing and JSON data handling.

* **Validation Policies**

Validation policies ensure the integrity and correctness of data:

Validate content/parameters/headers/status code / GraphQL request: Check the validity of content, parameters, headers, status codes, and GraphQL requests.

An example of policies that are useful is **Request Forwarding**:

![APIM - Policy Example](images/apim_apilifecyle_design_outoftheboxpolicies_RequestForwarding.PNG)

This policy is usually inherited from the global scope via the <base/> tag. If no specific policy is set, it defaults to the base configuration.
Timeout Settings: The forwarding timeout can be configured between 30 seconds to 10 minutes, with the default being 5 minutes.
Redirect Handling: It can be configured to follow redirects or, by default, return them to the caller.

* You can configure Retry (<retry/>)

Triggering Conditions: Retry is triggered when a specified expression evaluates to true.
Backoff Intervals: Offers options for fixed, linear, or exponential backoff intervals.
Fast First Retry: An optional feature for a quick retry attempt.
Request Copy: Does not retain a copy of the request automatically, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

* Limit Concurrency (<limit-concurrency/>)

Concurrency Cap: Caps the number of concurrent requests forwarded to the backend to prevent overloading.
Policy Integration: Can be used in conjunction with other policies to limit the number of requests entering enclosed policies.
Set Backend Service (<set-backend-service/>)

Runtime Changes: Allows changing the backend service during runtime, providing flexibility in managing backend services.
Conditional Policies: Can be configured with conditional policies for blue/green deployment, ensuring smooth transitions and updates.

Azure API Management provides a range of security features to protect APIs from these threats.

Let us take a look at securing the different planes of Azure API Management.

![APIM - APIM Planes](images/apim_apilifecyle_secure_planes.PNG)

| Plane Name        | Used For                                                          |  
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| User Plane        | Securing user interactions and data at the entry point.           |  
| Management Plane  | Managing and securing interactions between API providers and the management system. |  
| Data Plane        | Securing the flow and integrity of data between the gateway and backend services. |  

![APIM - Data Plane](images/apim_apilifecyle_secure_dataplanes.PNG)

In today's interconnected digital landscape, securing backend APIs is paramount. One key strategy for achieving this is through robust data plane security. This layered defense mechanism protects sensitive data and applications from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. Let's delve deeper into how data plane security works and the roles of its components.

**Firewall: Blocking Suspicious Requests**

The first line of defense in data plane security is the firewall. It acts as a gatekeeper, scrutinizing incoming requests to block any that appear suspicious. The firewall employs several rule sets and mechanisms to identify and mitigate potential threats:

* OWASP Core Rule Sets: These are standardized rules for detecting common web application security risks.
* Bot Protection Rule Set: This helps in identifying and blocking automated bot traffic that could pose security risks.
* Custom Rules: Organizations can define their own rules tailored to their specific security requirements.

**Gateway: Authenticating and Authorizing Requests**

Once a request passes through the firewall, it reaches the gateway. The gateway is responsible for performing in-depth request authentication and authorization to ensure only valid requests proceed. Key functions of the gateway include:

* Authentication Mechanisms: OAuth 2, client certificates, and custom authentication methods.
* Authorization Mechanisms: Including IP filtering and custom authorization rules.
* Request/Response Validation: Ensuring that both incoming requests and outgoing responses meet predefined security criteria.
* Throttling: Managing the rate of incoming requests to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

**Backend APIs: Fine-Grained Authorization**

The final layer involves the backend APIs themselves, which must accept requests only from trusted sources. This layer applies fine-grained authorization to enforce strict access controls. Key security measures include:

* HTTP Basic (Shared Secret): Simple but effective method for authenticating requests.
* Mutual Certificates: Ensuring both client and server authenticate each other.
* OAuth 2: Secure token-based authentication.
* Managed Identity and IP Filtering: This involves restricting access based on IP addresses and managing identities to enforce security policies.
* Private Networking: Isolating the APIs within a secure network environment.

* Internal
* External

The [internal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-using-with-internal-vnet?tabs=stv2&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) option is more secure, as it is not exposed to the public internet. It is ideal for scenarios where you want to restrict access to your APIs to only internal clients or services.
The [external](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-using-with-vnet?tabs=stv2&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) option is exposed to the public internet, making it accessible to a broader audience. This option suits scenarios where you want to provide public access to your APIs.

![APIM - External](images/apim_apilifecyle_secure_external.PNG)

![APIM - External](images/apim_apilifecyle_secure_internal.PNG)

You can also use the best of both worlds by allowing Azure API Management in Internal mode to publish APIs to the Internet or external customers and using Azure Front Door or Azure Application Gateway to expose the APIs to the Internet.

![APIM - Internal with WAF](images/apim_apilifecyle_secure_internalwaf.PNG)

Deciding between using Azure API Management (APIM) in Internal or External mode depends on your specific requirements for security, accessibility, and network configuration. Here are some key considerations:

* Internal Mode

Accessibility: The APIM endpoints are accessible only from within the Virtual Network (VNet) via an internal load balancer.
Security: This mode is more secure as it restricts access to the APIM endpoints to only those resources within the VNet.
Use Case: This is ideal for scenarios where you need to protect sensitive APIs and ensure that they are only accessible from within your organization’s network.

* External Mode

Accessibility: The APIM endpoints are accessible from the public internet via an external load balancer.
Security: While still secure, this mode allows for broader access, including from the internet.
Use Case: Suitable for scenarios where you must expose APIs to external clients or partners.

Deciding between Internal and External modes depends on your specific requirements and use case. Consider your APIs' security, accessibility, and network configuration needs to determine the best mode for your scenario.

For example:

Security Requirements: Internal mode is preferable if your APIs handle sensitive data.
Accessibility Needs: If you need to provide access to external clients, external mode is the way to go.
Network Configuration: Consider your existing network setup and how APIM will integrate.

![APIM Compliance](images/apim_apilifecyle_secure_compliance.PNG)

Azure API Management meets Compliance requirements, such as:

* GDPR
* HIPAA
* ISO 27001 PCI

More information on the compliance can be found here: [Azure compliance documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)

### 🚀 Publish

![API Lifecycle - Publish](images/apim_apilifecyle_publish.PNG)

Once an API is designed, developed, and secured, it is ready to be published. Azure API Management offers a range of features to help you publish and manage your APIs effectively.

One of those features is the Developer Portal.

![APIM - Developer Portal](images/apim_apilifecyle_publish_DeveloperPortal.PNG)

The Developer Portal in API Management _(APIM)_ is a discovery and self-onboarding point for application developers. Here are the primary functions and features it offers:

* Discover APIs:
Developers can explore and find available APIs to integrate into their applications.
* Learn How to Use Them:
The portal provides comprehensive documentation and tutorials to help developers understand how to use the APIs effectively.
* Test Them Out with Interactive Console:
Developers can interactively test the APIs within the portal using a built-in console. This allows them to see how the APIs work and validate their functionality before integrating them into their applications.
* Create and Manage Accounts:
Developers can create accounts on the portal, manage their profiles, and keep track of their API usage and subscriptions.
* Request and Manage API Access:
The portal enables developers to request access to specific APIs and manage their access permissions, ensuring they have the appropriate level of access for their needs.
* Analyze API Usage:
Developers can analyze their API usage data to monitor performance, identify trends, and optimize their application's interaction with the APIs.

The Developer Portal is customizable, allowing organizations to tailor it to their needs and branding. It is a central hub for developers to discover, learn, and interact with APIs, streamlining the API consumption process and fostering collaboration between API providers and consumers.

![APIM - Revisions and Versions](images/apim_apilifecyle_publig_RevisionsVersexample.PNG)


Now that we have reviewed the Revisions and versions, let's examine [Products](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-add-products?tabs=azure-portal&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).

> In Azure API Management, a product contains one or more APIs, a usage quota, and the terms of use. After a product is published, developers can subscribe to the product and begin to use the product's APIs.

APIs _(Application Programming Interfaces)_ enable seamless interaction between software applications. However, managing multiple APIs can be challenging. Bundling APIs with products has emerged as an effective strategy to streamline this process.

![APIM - Products](images/apim_apilifecyle_publish_BundleAPIs.PNG)

API bundling involves grouping multiple APIs into a single package or product. This approach simplifies developers' and organizations' management, subscription, and usage of APIs.

* Developer Portal
Browse Products: Developers can explore various API products available in the portal.
Subscribe to Products: Once a suitable product is identified, developers can subscribe to it.
Manage Subscriptions and Keys: The portal allows developers to manage their subscriptions and obtain the necessary API keys.

* Management Plane
Manage Products and API Associations: Administrators can define and manage the associations between products and their respective APIs.
Define Product-Scoped Policies: Specific policies can be set for each product, ensuring controlled and secure access.
Approve and Manage Subscriptions: Administrators can approve subscription requests and manage existing subscriptions.
Collect and Analyze Usage Data: Usage data is collected and analyzed to monitor and optimize API performance.
Monetize Access: Administrators can monetize API access by setting pricing plans and usage limits.

* Gateway
Authenticate API Requests: The gateway authenticates incoming API requests using the provided keys.
Execute Product-Scoped Policies: It ensures that the defined policies for each product are enforced during API execution.

![APIM - Products](images/apim_apilifecyle_publish_APISubscriptions.PNG)

Understanding the relationships between users, groups, products, APIs, and subscriptions is crucial for efficient and effective management.

| Entity         | Relationships                                      |  
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|  
| **User**       | - Can have many Subscriptions                      |  
|                | - Can belong to many Groups                        |  
| **Group**      | - Can contain many Users                           |  
|                | - Can have many Subscriptions                      |  
|                | - Built-in: Guest, Developer, Admin                |  
|                | - Custom: native or Entra ID                       |  
| **Subscription**| - Each Subscription is related to one User or Group|  
|                | - Can provide access to one Product                |  
| **Product**    | - Can be part of many Subscriptions                |  
|                | - Can contain many APIs                            |  
| **API**        | - Each API is part of one Product                  |  


### 📏 Scale

![API Lifecycle - Scale](images/apim_apilifecyle_scale.PNG)

Azure and the Azure API Management service have a significant [global footprint](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), with 44+ public regions worldwide, 6 regions for US government use, and 4 regions in China, showcasing its extensive infrastructure and specialized services.

![APIM - Scale](images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_GlobalPresence.PNG)

![APIM - Multi-region](images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_Multiregion.PNG)

Azure API Management's multi-region deployment offers a robust solution for improving API reliability and reducing latency. Let's dive into the key features and benefits of this setup.
Improved Availability and Reduced Latency
 
One of the standout features of Azure API Management's multi-region deployment is the significantly improved availability of the data plane. You can expect minimal downtime with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99% compared to the standard 99.95%. This increased reliability ensures that your APIs remain accessible to users worldwide, enhancing the overall user experience.

* Scalability Across Multiple Regions
 
A single Premium instance of Azure API Management can be scaled across multiple regions. This flexibility allows you to deploy additional units into the primary or secondary regions based on your needs. However, regions and units come at an additional cost. This scalability ensures that your API infrastructure can grow alongside your business demands.

* Primary and Secondary Regions
 
In a multi-region deployment, the primary region hosts all components, including the gateway, developer portal, management API, and developer portal API. If the primary region becomes unavailable, these components are inaccessible, highlighting the importance of a robust primary region setup.

On the other hand, secondary regions host only the gateway. These secondary gateways can operate on the last received configuration while the primary area is unavailable. They periodically try to reconnect and catch up, ensuring that API requests continue to be processed even during primary region outages.

* Global API Availability
 
One of the most significant advantages of multi-region deployment is that all APIs are available in every region. Azure Traffic Manager plays a crucial role in routing requests to the closest available region in this setup. Using Traffic Manager’s performance routing with a 5-minute Time-to-Live (TTL), API requests are efficiently managed, reducing latency and improving response times for users worldwide.

![APIM - Multi-Region Example](images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_MultiregionEExample.PNG)

Lets take a look at the nuances on the anatomy of an Azure API Management instance.

![APIM - Anatomy](images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_AnatomyAPIM.PNG)

An Azure API Management instance with 1 unit, represented by two machines (Machine #1 and Machine #2). Each machine has a set of components that work together to manage and secure APIs.

| Machine   | Component      | Description                                                                 |  
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Machine #1| Control-Plane  | The administrative interface for configuring and managing APIs and policies.|  
|           | Gateway        | Handles API requests and applies rate limiting and authentication policies.|  
|           | Developer Portal | Customizable portal for developers to discover, learn, and use APIs.       |  
| Machine #2| Control-Plane  | Redundant administrative interface for high availability.                   |  
|           | Gateway        | Redundant API Gateway for load balancing and fault tolerance.               |  
|           | Developer Portal | Another instance of the Developer Portal to ensure high availability.      |  

This is a typical setup of an Azure API Management instance. It emphasizes redundancy and high availability by distributing core components (Control-Plane, Gateway, and Developer Portal) across multiple machines. This setup ensures the API management service remains operational even if one machine fails. 

However, to ensure high availability and disaster recovery, one may want to expand the Azure API Management instance to another region.

![APIM - Scale](images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_AnatomyAPIMSecondRegion.PNG)

When you scale an Azure API Management instance to another region, you are essentially creating a secondary region deployment. This setup provides high availability and disaster recovery capabilities, ensuring your APIs remain accessible even during a regional outage by expanding the Gateway service. All Control planet traffic and the developer portal are still managed by the primary region, however your APIs will still function.

![APIM - Availability Zones](images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_AvaliabilityZone.PNG)

By deploying your APIM instance across two or more Availability Zones within a single region, you can achieve a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99%. 
In a multi-region deployment, using Availability Zones can enhance the resiliency of the primary region. Even if one zone experiences an outage, the services can operate seamlessly from another zone within the same region.

Every unit deployed across the Availability Zones includes all necessary API Management components, ensuring comprehensive coverage and functionality.

Using Availability Zones in Azure API Management provides enhanced availability, reliability, and resiliency for your API services, especially in a multi-region deployment. This setup ensures that your APIs remain accessible and operational even in the face of regional outages or disruptions.

Now, let us take a look at self-hosting your own Gateway. 

![APIM - Self-hosted Gateway](images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_SelfHostedAPIGateway.PNG)

The self-hosted API gateway is functionally equivalent to the managed gateway. This feature provides flexibility, allowing the gateway to be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, depending on the organization's needs. The self-hosted gateway requires only outgoing connectivity to Azure _(API Management Gateway)_ on port 443.

The self-hosted gateway connects to a "parent" API Management service in Azure. It pulls down configuration settings and pushes up telemetry data to Azure. This integration with Azure allows for centralized management and monitoring, simplifying the oversight and control of the API gateway.

![APIM - Self-hosted Gateway SKU](images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_SelfHostedAPIGatewaySKU.PNG)

Now, let us take a look at [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) and Azure API Management.

:::info
> [Azure API Management is a way to create consistent and modern API gateways for back-end services, including those built with Dapr](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/integrations/azure/azure-api-management/). You can enable Dapr support in self-hosted API Management gateways to allow them to:

Forward requests to Dapr services
Send messages to Dapr Pub/Sub topics
Trigger Dapr output bindings
:::

![APIM - Dapr](images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_Dapr.PNG)

* Dapr can work with self-hosted Azure API Management gateways and invoke services running in different pods. This allows for seamless communication between microservices within the Kubernetes cluster. 
* Dapr supports publish/subscribe messaging, enabling applications to send messages to topics and other applications to subscribe to these topics
* Dapr can trigger outbound bindings, which allows it to interact with external systems and services. This feature is useful for integrating with external databases, message queues, and other services.

By integrating Dapr with self-hosted gateways, the architecture's complexity is reduced, and common tasks like service discovery, state management, and pub/sub are simplified.

Azure API Management offers an isolated SKU, a dedicated instance of Azure API Management that runs on a single-tenant virtual network. This SKU is ideal for organizations that require enhanced security, compliance, and isolation for their APIs.

![APIM - Isolated SKU](images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_IsolatedTenant.PNG)

> The purpose of the Isolated tier is to enable the use of all the features of the API Management Premium tier in highly regulated industries where compute environment isolation is a requirement. 

Now, let us discuss [Backup and Restore](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-disaster-recovery-backup-restore?tabs=powershell&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).

![APIM - Backup and Restore](images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_IBackupRestore.PNG)

| Scope                       | Captures everything but reports and custom domain settings in a blob.                                    |  
| Service Configuration       | Operations such as scaling and upgrades are blocked while the backup is in progress.                     |  
| Changes                     | Any changes applied after the backup starts are not included in the backup.                              |  
| **Restore**                 |                                                                                                          |  
| Duration | It Could take 30 minutes or more, depending on the size.                                                     |  
| Availability                | The instance is not available while the restore is in progress.                                          |  
| Custom Domain               | Custom domain configurations need to be re-applied manually after the restore.                           |  
| **Standby Failover Instance** |                                                                                                          |  
| Setup                       | Create a backup instance in a different region in advance.                                               |  
| Configuration               | Configure the custom domain identically to the active instance.                                          |  
| Sync                        | Periodically sync the configuration with the active instance to achieve the desired RPO (Recovery Point Objective). |  
| Failover                    | To failover, update the CNAME to reference the backup instance.                                         |  
| Scalability                 | Scale up the backup instance if and as required.                                                         |  
| **Summary**                 |                                                                                                          |  
| Backup                      | This process is relatively quick but does block certain operations and does not capture changes made after the backup begins. |  
| Restore                     | This can be time-consuming and renders the instance unavailable during the process. Manual intervention is required for custom domain settings. |  
| Standby Failover            | Setting up a standby instance in advance can significantly reduce downtime and improve recovery times. This involves periodic synchronization and possibly updating DNS records during a failover. |  

:::Warning
Backup and restore need to be configured. It is not enabled by default.
Backup is not possible in Consumption.
Backup and restore could take between 30 minutes to 1 hour.
Taking a backup or restore puts the API Management Management plane in a read-only state while the backup or restore is in progress.
The backups expire after 30 days.
:::

Backup and restore is where you can consider Infrastructure as Code and APIOps functionality and testing. 

###  Monitor and Analyze

![API Lifecycle - Monitor and Analyze](images/apim_apilifecyle_MonitorAnalyze.PNG)

Now we need to monitor and analyze the APIs and API Management to ensure that they are performing as expected and to identify any issues that may arise. Azure API Management provides a range of monitoring and analytics features to help you track API usage, performance, and health.

The "[API Inspector](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/observability?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)" feature monitors and analyzes API requests. It provides detailed information about each request, including the URL, headers, and response status code. This feature helps troubleshoot issues and optimize API performance.

*1. Optional, depending on the configuration of the feature in Azure API Management*

*2. Optional, depending on the configuration of the gateway*

*3. The self-hosted gateway currently does not send diagnostic logs to Azure Monitor. However, it is possible to configure and persist logs locally where the self-hosted gateway is deployed.*
