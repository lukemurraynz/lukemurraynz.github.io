PoC, PoT, Prototype, MVP, Pilot - what do they all mean? What is the difference between them and when should you use them?

# üöÄ Introduction

Today, we are going to take a look at a technical Cloud Product Development Lifecycle - in my eyes, understanding these terminologies are key to determing:

* What kind of resources _(ie both technological and human)_ do you need to dedicate to a product? 
* Where to align lifecycle managemement to your application or service?
* How likelihood is the product to make it a good market fit, or solve an issue?
* Keep your product lean, to avoid wasting the wrong resources at the wrong time
* Shift to a product based mindset
* Focus on innovation, and early feedback loops

And of course - what to expect when people start using these words, often thrown together in a conversation, and sometimes even put in writing in Statement of Works and Requests for Proposals.

# üé® Design Thinking and Agile

Using Design Thinking - _(Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test, Implement)_ as a base - a Product needs to align with actual customer needs, its an ilterative process, as a Product or service itself isn't static. We live in a VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complexity, Ambiguity) world, where customers expect more from their technology _(as they should)_ to help empower their own needs, in a secure and reliable manner.

Agile is about the speed to adapt, not the velocity to deliver, so if we take in Agile delivery, Design thinking methologies, its no surprise that we need to break the product lifecycle into specific stages, to get faster, more immediate feedback and make sure we are concentrating on the right success metrics for our product at the right time.

# üö™ Product Lifecycle Gates

So let us dig a bit deeper into some of the gates to consider when shifting a product through this lifecycle, before you reach the next stage _(for example from MVP to Pilot)_:

![Product Development Lifecycle Gates](images/ProductDevelopmentLifecycleGates.png)

1. Problem Definition and Technical Feasibility
(Helps determine if you're at PoT or PoC stage)

What is the primary problem this application/workload/service is trying to solve?
Do we have enough technical understanding to validate whether this can be built?
Are there specific technical risks or uncertainties that need validation before proceeding further?
Is there an existing technology or approach that can achieve the desired outcome, or does this require exploration?
Are stakeholders aligned on the goals of the solution at this stage?

2. User and Business Alignment
(Determines if you're ready for PoC, Prototype, or MVP stages)

Who are the target users or audiences for this application/workload/service?
What are the critical business outcomes or objectives tied to this solution?
Do we have user personas or initial feedback to validate assumptions?
Is there clarity on how this solution will fit into existing business processes or workflows?
Are there measurable KPIs or success criteria defined for the next stage?

3. Functionality and Design
(Helps decide if Prototype or MVP is needed)

Do we have clear requirements and design principles for the application?
What specific features or functionality are critical to test user engagement?
Is the goal to explore design and usability (Prototype) or to deliver something functional for user adoption (MVP)?
How much feedback or iteration is needed to validate user needs or business value?
Are there competing priorities (e.g., time-to-market vs. feature completeness) that influence this stage?

4. Real-World Validation
(Clarifies readiness for Pilot stage)

Has the application/workload/service undergone sufficient technical, functional, and usability testing?
Are there operational risks or challenges that require validation in a controlled environment?
Do we have a defined test group or environment to deploy the solution and gather feedback?
What are the success metrics for the pilot phase (e.g., adoption rate, performance, operational readiness)?
What‚Äôs the contingency plan if the pilot reveals significant issues?

5. Scalability and Operational Readiness
(Determines readiness for Production)

Has the solution demonstrated scalability under expected workloads?
Are there any technical, security, or compliance gaps preventing full-scale deployment?
Is the team equipped with monitoring, support, and incident response processes?
What are the ongoing maintenance and operational requirements?
Is there a plan for onboarding users or customers at scale?

6. Post-Launch Evolution and Sunset Planning
(Addresses long-term product lifecycle considerations)

What is the plan for iterating and improving the product post-launch?
How will we track performance, gather feedback, and prioritize enhancements?
Is there a decommissioning or migration plan in case of obsolescence or replacement?
What‚Äôs the budget and resource allocation for ongoing updates?
What external factors (e.g., market changes, technology updates) could impact the solution's longevity?

# üìö Scenarios

Lets take a look at 2 scenarios, where we can see how these stages can be applied. Scenario #1 is the development of a Azure Landing Zone _(yes it doesn't have to be specifically a product - this is a way of thinking, more of a guideline/framework then a rule)_ and Scenario #2 is the creation of an eCommerce website.

Here is the updated table with the sunset row added at the bottom:

| **Gate**                  | **Scenario #1. Azure Landing Zone Implementation**                                                                                   | **Scenario #2. E-Commerce Website**                                                                                       |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gate 1: Technical Feasibility Validated | - All resource types required for the landing zone deployment are provisioned successfully using IaC (Infrastructure as Code).  \n- A network topology supporting hybrid cloud connectivity is deployed and passes end-to-end connectivity tests. | - The website backend can retrieve product data from a database within 50ms under test conditions.  \n- A sandbox environment successfully processes simulated payments through the payment gateway. |
| Gate 2: Stakeholder Approval             | - Governance policies for tagging, cost management, and resource compliance are reviewed and signed off by stakeholders.  \n- Cloud adoption teams approve the initial structure for subscription and resource group hierarchy.            | - Stakeholders approve a product backlog containing prioritized features for the MVP based on user stories.  \n- Design mockups of key pages (e.g., homepage, product page, checkout page) are reviewed and signed off by business stakeholders. |
| Gate 3: MVP Adoption Metrics Met         | - The MVP landing zone enables 3 application teams to deploy workloads without manual intervention.  \n- Monitoring and logging solutions for the MVP environment are active and provide actionable insights within 5 minutes of an incident. | - The MVP site achieves at least 100 daily active users within 2 weeks of launch.  \n- Basic checkout functionality works end-to-end, including order placement and confirmation email delivery. |
| Gate 4: Pilot Success Criteria Achieved  | - The pilot environment supports the deployment of workloads across all required regions with no SLA violations over a 4-week period.  \n- All critical governance, security, and operational policies pass compliance testing in the pilot.             | - During a limited launch, 1,000 transactions are processed with less than 1% failure rate.  \n- Pilot users provide a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 7 or higher for their experience on the site. |
| Gate 5: Go-Live Decision                 | - All key stakeholders approve readiness for production based on agreed KPIs (e.g., uptime, cost optimization, and security).  \n- Documentation for deployment, governance, and user onboarding is complete and validated by end users.         | - The e-commerce platform handles a load test of 20,000 concurrent users with a 99.9% success rate in order processing.  \n- Critical user journeys (search, add to cart, checkout) are tested with zero critical defects reported in production-readiness testing. |
| **Gate 6: Sunset**                         | - All resources associated with the landing zone are decommissioned safely and cost-effectively, with no unexpected impact on remaining environments.  \n- Final cost and usage reports for the project are reviewed and shared with stakeholders. | - All user data is successfully migrated or anonymized according to privacy policies.  \n- All legal and financial obligations are met for the e-commerce platform, and any necessary shutdown or scaling activities are completed without affecting the remaining infrastructure. |

# üèÅ Conclusion
