Microsoft recently unveiled [Service Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/service-groups/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) in Azure, now available in limited public preview—and they’re already shaping up to be a game changer for cloud governance.

If you’ve ever struggled with managing sprawling applications across multiple resource groups, subscriptions, and teams, Service Groups are designed with you in mind.

Where Azure Policy, Resource Graph, Tags, and Management Groups give you compliance, visibility, and hierarchy, Service Groups add an entirely new dimension: flexible, application-centric grouping of your Azure resources—without being limited by deployment boundaries.

Imagine being able to view, report on, and manage an entire application or workload—no matter where its resources live. Whether you’re in FinOps trying to track costs, in Ops trying to view health, or a security lead wanting to understand exposure, Service Groups give you the lens you’ve been missing. 

Today we are going to look at using the [Terraform AzAPI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/terraform/overview-azapi-provider?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) to deploy [Service Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/service-groups/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) in Azure.

:::info
Service Groups support up to 10 levels of nested hierarchy and let you aggregate resources based on projects, services, shared dependencies, or criticality—even across multiple subscriptions or environments.

They don’t change RBAC or policy inheritance—this isn’t a new deployment scope. Instead, they work in parallel to your existing structure, offering clarity and insight without compromising security or control.

Use them to:

* Create workload-centric views
* Track shared service dependencies
* Report and monitor costs across scattered resources
* Visualize health and operational state holistically

As someone who works with complex environments every day, I see Service Groups as a long-overdue capability that simplifies cloud operations and bridges the gap between governance and agility. Make sure you check out a video I did on the [Azure Service Groups](https://youtu.be/64uj-syYv5Y) for further information.

> It’s still early days, but the flexibility, clarity, and insight Service Groups bring are already proving invaluable. If you're managing large Azure estates, [sign up for the preview](https://aka.ms/sgp), test it out, and give feedback to help shape what’s next.

You can find my Terraform code for deploying Service Groups in Azure [lukemurraynz/terraform-azapi-servicegroups](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/terraform-azapi-servicegroups).

Aimed at a draft Platform Engineering team, this example shows how to use Service Groups to create a clear, manageable structure for your Azure resources; the Root Service Group is created by default, however, like Management Groups, you can specify a nested structure in my example I have:

Root (Tenant ID)
├── Platform Engineering
│   ├── Platform Infrastructure
│   ├── Platform DevOps
│   └── Platform Data
├── Application Teams
│   ├── Customer Experience
│   │   ├── E-commerce Platform
│   │   └── Customer Support
│   └── Internal Operations
│       ├── Finance Systems
│       └── Human Resources
└── Security & Compliance
    └── Identity & Access Management

With Service Group members being created for each of the service groups, in this example, I have created a Storage Account as a member of the Identity and Access Management Service Group and a Resource Group called open as a member of the E-commerce Platform _(which includes resources inside that group by default)_.

This code creates a structured hierarchy of service groups, each representing a logical grouping of resources based on their function or ownership. The `azapi_resource` blocks define the service groups, while the `azapi_resource` blocks with type `Microsoft.Relationships/serviceGroupMember` establish relationships between specific Azure resources and the service groups.
