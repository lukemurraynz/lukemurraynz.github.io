As part of the [Azure Back to School](https://azurebacktoschool.github.io/) event for 2025, we are here to take a look at [Azure Landing Zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), specifically [Platform Landing Zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#platform-landing-zones-vs-application-landing-zones), and the deployment of the Platform Landing Zone, using an [accelerator](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Landing-Zones/accelerator/) and Azure DevOps for the CI/CD.

## Introduction to Azure Landing Zones

Azure Landing Zones provide a structured approach for designing and implementing cloud environments in Azure. They are essential for organizations looking to migrate, modernize, and innovate their applications at scale1.

## Understanding Azure Landing Zone Accelerators
Azure Landing Zone Accelerators are automation frameworks designed to expedite the deployment of Azure Landing Zone architecture2. They come in two flavors:

* Bicep Accelerator
* Terraform Accelerator

Both accelerators reached version 1.0 milestone, marking their general availability2.

Key Components of Azure Landing Zones
Platform Landing Zone: Shared services like identity, connectivity, and management1

Application Landing Zone: Specific environments for particular applications or workloads1

###  Benefits of Using Azure Landing Zone Accelerators
Rapid deployment of Azure Landing Zone architecture

Adherence to best practices

Customizable to meet specific organizational needs

Minimizes effort in analyzing and creating deployment strategies2

## Deploying Azure Landing Zones with Terraform

### Azure Landing Zone Accelerator for Terraform

Pre-requisites: Configure credentials and subscriptions

Bootstrap: Set up CI/CD pipelines (supports GitHub and Azure DevOps)

Run: Deploy the Azure Landing Zone architecture2

Terraform Landing Zone Vending Module
Designed for deploying individual landing zones

Capabilities include:

Subscription creation and management group placement

Networking (hub & spoke, vWAN, mesh peering)

Role assignments

Resource provider registration

Resource group creation

User-assigned managed identity creation3

## Best Practices for Azure Landing Zone Implementation

Start with the Azure Landing Zone Accelerator for most scenarios

Consider multiple-region deployments for resilience

Implement centralized logging and monitoring

Utilize management groups and Azure Policy for governance

Regularly review and update your landing zone configuration6
