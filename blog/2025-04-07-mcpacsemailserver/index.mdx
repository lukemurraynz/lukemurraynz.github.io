description: Learn how to use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect GitHub Copilot to Azure Communication Services for sending emails directly from AI interactions.

No doubt, you've heard the acronymn 'MCP' before or [Model Context Protocol _(MCP)_](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), opensourced by Anthropic in November of 2024 it has quickly become the goto standard for connecting AI assistants to systems of various types.

> The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these servers.

Today we are going to use the MCP protocol to connect to [Azure Communication Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and send an email from an MCP client and server running on a GitHub Codespace from GitHub Copilot.

{/* truncate */}

The MCP protocol has 2 different transport layers:

* Stdio transport: This is the default transport layer. It uses standard input and output to communicate between the MCP client and server. This is useful for local development and testing.
* HTTP transport: This transport layer uses HTTP to communicate between the MCP client and server. This is useful for production environments where the MCP client and server are running on different machines.

In our usecase, we are going to use the Stdio transport layer. This is because we are running both the MCP client and server on the same machine (GitHub Codespace). 

There are also different types of primitives, that an MCP server can expose:

* Resources are a core primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allow servers to expose data and content that can be read by clients and used as context for LLM interactions.
* Prompts enable servers to define reusable prompt templates and workflows that clients can easily surface to users and LLMs. They provide a powerful way to standardize and share common LLM interactions.
* Tools are a powerful primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enable servers to expose executable functionality to clients. Through tools, LLMs can interact with external systems, perform computations, and take actions in the real world.

We are going to use the `Tool` primitive to expose a tool that will send an email using Azure Communication Services. The tool will be exposed by the MCP server and will be used by the MCP client to send the email, when we prompt it in GitHub Copilot chat.

The MCP server will be running on a GitHub Codespace and will be used to send an email using Azure Communication Services. The MCP client will be running on the same Codespace and will be used to send the email using GPT-4o.
 
 Using Python, we are going to use the [MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) to do alot of the heavy lifting for us. The SDK is a wrapper around the MCP protocol and allows us to easily create an MCP server, and thanks to a recent update by [GitHub Model Context Protocol (MCP) is now avaliable in Public preview in GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-agent-mode-activated/#model-context-protocol-mcp-is-now-available-in-public-preview), which allows us us to use the MCP protocol straight from GitHub Copilot chat without needing Claude Desktop for example, installed.

We are going to create 3 tools:

1. send_email
Purpose: Sends a simple email to a single recipient.
Parameters:
* recipient: The email address of the recipient.
* subject: The subject line of the email.
* content: The HTML or plain text content of the email.
Usage: This tool is used for sending basic emails without attachments.

2. send_email_with_attachments
Purpose: Sends an email with file attachments to a single recipient.
Parameters:
* recipient: The email address of the recipient.
* subject: The subject line of the email.
* content: The HTML or plain text content of the email.
* attachments: A list of file paths to attach to the email.
Usage: This tool is used when you need to send documents, images, or other files along with the email.

3. send_bulk_email
Purpose: Sends the same email to multiple recipients in a single operation.
Parameters:
* recipients: A list of email addresses to send the email to.
* subject: The subject line of the email.
* content: The HTML or plain text content of the email.
Usage: This tool is ideal for sending announcements, updates, or newsletters to a group of recipients.

Each tool will be implemented as a function in Python, and we will use the MCP Python SDK to expose these functions as tools in the MCP server. The MCP client will then be able to call these tools to send emails using Azure Communication Services based on the prompts we provide in GitHub Copilot chat.

You can find the ACS Email MCP server code on my GitHub repo here: [lukemurraynz/mcp-server-acsemail](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/mcp-server-acsemail). Feel free to clone it, run it, and open any Pull Requests if you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements.
:::

Due to the python depedencies, we will be using a devcontainer, using the [python:3.12-bullseye](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/devcontainers-python) image as our base image. This will allow us to use the latest version of Python, and the postCreateCommand we will install the python depedencies using pip.

mcp

python-dotenv
```
Assuming you have the Azure Communication Services Email resource created, and the connection string saved in a `.env` file in the root of your project. The connection string should look something like this:

```txt
# Azure Communication Services credentials
ACS_CONNECTION_STRING=endpoint='https://azcommunicationservicestest.australia.communication.azure.com/;accesskey=FPipiKEH95KCHYQnJOxqMV0P7ZpP3qcKWZHaAhulbKCWI3fPyQZQJQQJ99BDACULyCphGPgtAAAAAZCS58g3'
ACS_SENDER_ADDRESS='DoNotReply@58b87ce7-7f73-444a-ba0b-d754677503cf.azurecomm.net'
```
The `ACS_SENDER_ADDRESS` is the email address that will be used to send the email. This is the email address that will appear in the "From" field of the email.

The Python code for the MCP server is as follows:

```python
# basic import

```

To allow GitHub Copilot to recognise and run the server, a `.vscode/mcp.json` file is created to run the server.

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "email": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": [
                "/workspaces/mcp-server-acsemail/src/server.py",
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

So lets test this, first we will test an email of the selection using the `send_email` tool. 

![MCP Email Test](images/MCP-ACS_SendEmail.gif)

Next lets test the same, but to multiple recipients using the `send_bulk_email` tool.

![MCP Email Test](images/MCP-ACS_BulkSendEmail.gif)

Last - lets try with sending the readme as an attachment using the `send_email_with_attachments` tool.

Hopefully that gives you a glimpse of how to use the MCP protocol to connect to [Azure Communication Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and send emails using GitHub Copilot chat. The MCP protocol is a powerful tool that allows you to connect AI assistants to systems of various types, and with the recent updates to GitHub Copilot, it is now easier than ever to use! This was just my first test usecase, can't wait to see what else we can do with it!
