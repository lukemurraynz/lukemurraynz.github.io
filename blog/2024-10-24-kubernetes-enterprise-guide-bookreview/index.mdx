I had the privilege to being able to read and review the ‘[**Kubernetes - An Enterprise Guide**](https://www.amazon.com.au/Kubernetes-Enterprise-Effectively-containerize-applications-dp-1835086950/dp/1835086950)’ book by Marc Boorshtein (Author), Scott Surovich (Author). The book is published by Packt Publishing and is available on Amazon. 

> This was the 3rd edition of the book, but I feel there was no need to read the previous editions to understand the content of this book, but being 3rd edition, also means that any mistakes or learnings from the past 2 editions have been considered.

> The book is a great read for anyone who is looking to understand Kubernetes from the ground up. The book is divided into 18 chapters and covers a wide range of topics from the basics of Kubernetes to advanced topics like security, monitoring, and troubleshooting. The book is written in a very easy to understand language and is full of examples and diagrams to help you understand the concepts better.

Lets dig into this a bit more:

First the vision of the book is really about focussing on what you need to run Kubernetes in an Enterprise environment, based on the real-world experience from the authors, so naturally the questions I wanted to know if this book would answer in its 623 pages of content were:

1.	Does it adequately cover core Kubernetes concepts relevant to enterprises?
2.	Does it address multi-cluster and multi-cloud Kubernetes deployments?
3.	Is the information backed by research, case studies, or industry best practices?
4.	Is the content accessible to the intended readers, whether they are developers, operations staff, or managers?

So, let’s go through each of these:

## **Q. Does it adequately cover core Kubernetes concepts relevant to enterprises?**

**I can definitely say yes – it does!**

The book starts with an introduction to Docker and container essentials, explaining the need for containerization and how Docker works. It also covers the installation and usage of Docker, before going into deploying your own Kubernetes cluster with KinD, and the various components that make up Kubernetes, and covering concepts such as Ingress, Deployment and Services, then exposing Load Balancer options, DNS considerations and identity across multiple chapters.

* Now, lets look at: **Q. Does it address multi-cluster and multi-cloud Kubernetes deployments?**

> **Kind of!**

As alluded to, it goes through setting up KinD (Kubernetes in Docker) multi-cluster configurations, and Kubelet options, multi-tenant vCluster configuration, global load balancing!

However, this book – takes a neutral stance on specific Cloud deployment options, i.e. AKS, EKS, concentrating more on integration, and whats happening in the cluster, vs the opinionated Cloud provider implementations, it does however touch on various integrations – with identity being a key component – with some demos _(as part of a github)_ repository to match, if you are looking for a book all about AKS and Cloud deployment – then in my opinion not the book for you, HOWEVER if you want to know what is actually happening in the background, and WHY the clusters, nodes, namespaces operate the way they do – then this is an ideal book, to full understand the concepts, which doesn’t make it less valuable, but more of a supplement for fully understanding what those Cloud providers obfuscate from.

## **Q. Is the information backed by research, case studies, or industry best practices?**

I always consider this, as it takes away any bias the authors may have, with more generalized guidance discovered from sweat and tears from the industry in general, and I can confirm that indeed it does!
The book features a lot of real-world examples, based on issues the authors have experienced throughout the years, and resolutions on how it has been implemented as well. The book also references external (trusted – i.e. kubernetes.io) sources where needed, to point readers to additional information.

## **Q. Is the content accessible to the intended readers, whether they are developers, operations staff, or managers?**

> **Short answer Yes!** 

My background is system administration (15+ years), so I approached this more from operations and delivery perspective, then a developer, so I have some bias there in my review, however key points are:

The book covered a great introduction into the concepts that make up Kubernetes, each chapter included step by step instructions, example demos supplied from a public git repo so get hands on (which was great!), managing secrets and cluster security with Gatekeeper and Dashboards! 

I would say, yes, this book definitely covers it for developers, operations staff, it is more aligned to technical readers, however as a Manager, there are a lot of concepts you can pick up as well, and the chapters can be skipped easily due to their names of build and deploy, if not of interest.

All in all – this is a great resource! Definitely learned a few things, great to get hands on with the guides, and knowledge checks at the end of the book! Definitely add and read this, if you want to understand Kubernetes, it builds your knowledge up from concepts, so it’s a book that can meet you where you are! I’m going to need to get a bigger bookshelf!
