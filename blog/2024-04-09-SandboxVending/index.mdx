When working with Microsoft Azure, you may want an environment for learning, whether for an individual or a team.

This article aims to highlight some reference implementation considerations for implementing a Sandbox environment within the Microsoft Azure platform.

When working with Microsoft Azure, you may want an environment for learning, whether for an individual or a team.

Cloud Sandboxes are contained, isolated environments that allow evaluation of new Cloud services and features (without impacting production environments).

:::info
This follows on from a previous article around [Sandbox Design](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/microsoft-azure-sandbox-design-considerations/) considerations, but with a focus on the implementation elements. This article aims to give you some ideas on how you can achieve Sandbox vending.
:::

A design area of the Ready phase of the [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), is the design and implementation of the [Azure Landing Zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), it would be asmiss of me not to bring up [Subscription vending](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/subscription-vending?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).

> "Subscription vending provides a platform mechanism for programmatically issuing subscriptions to application teams that need to deploy workloads."

Subscription Vending is the foundation, of what we are going to discuss today: Sandbox vending.

I am going to base this article on Unmanaged Sandboxes *(Subscription scoped Sandboxes)* however, alot of the same information can be used across Sandbox types.

## Planning

Before delving into the actual implementation, you need to consider what the Sandbox will look like, by answering questions such as:

| No. | Questions                                                                 | Why it's needed                                                                                                                                       |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | What is the purpose you want to use an Azure Sandbox for?                 | To understand the use case and requirements of the sandbox.                                                                                           |
| 2   | What subscription types are available and suitable for our needs?         | To choose the most cost-effective and suitable subscription for the needs.                                                                            |

Alot of these are organisational specific, but they are good technical considerations to consider when implementing and designing your Sandbox environment.

The Sandbox setup, will depend on the outputs of your Planning and requirements, just remember to keep it simple and easy to manage.
