When attempting to call Azure OpenAI, using a MAnaged Identity, you may encounter the following error:

:::warning
ERROR:root:Error generating response: Error code: 400 - {'error': {'code': 'Request is badly formated', 'message': 'Resource Id is badly formed or from wrong namespace: NA'}}
2024-11-26T18:57:08.224640325Z ERROR:root:Response content: b'{"error":{"code":"Request is badly formated","message":"Resource Id is badly formed or from wrong namespace: NA"}}'

I had issues, when attempting to call the Azure OpenAI endpoint from a container app, using a Managed Identity. The error message that was getting returned to my App was:

:::warning
An error generating a reponse.

After enabling some logging on my pyhon application, I was able to review the Console Logs of my Container _(running in a Container Apps environment)_ and found the following error message:

![Error](/images/Container_ErrorGenertingResponse.png)

After some testing, I was able to confirm using the API Keys that I could receive a response, but when using the Managed Identity, I was getting the error message.

My Azure OpenAI instance, was created with Infrastructure as Code, and noticed that my endpoint of my Azure OpenAI was:

```plaintext
https://eastus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/
```

And on a Azure OpenAI instance that was created in the Portal, the endpoint was:

```plaintext
https://azureopenaitestlol.openai.azure.com/
```

So I did a compare between the two resources:

And my IaC created Azure OpenAI resource was missing the: 

* customSubDomainName

After some digging, **I found that the [customSubDomainName](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) is the key to the issue.** When using a Managed Identity, the customSubDomainName is required to be set for Entra ID to be able to authenticate the request

:::info
Custom subdomain names are required to enable features like Microsoft Entra ID for authentication.
:::

So after updating the Azure OpenAI  resource to use the subdomain, updated my environment variables to use the right Azure OpenAI endpoint _(and make sure that the CLIENT_ID of the User Assigned Managed identity is using is correct)_ I was able to successfully call the Azure OpenAI endpoint using the Managed Identity.
