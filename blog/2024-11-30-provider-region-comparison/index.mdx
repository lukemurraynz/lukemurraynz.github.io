description: Compare the capabilities and services available in the new Azure region for example, New Zealand North, with those in Australia East.

With the release of the [New Zealand North](https://datacenters.microsoft.com/globe/explore?info=region_newzealandnorth) Azure Region on the horizon, I wanted a way to measure what capabilities can be deployed in the new region, particularly in comparison to Australia East.

To do so, I wrote a script that uses the Azure CLI to query the [provider namespaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) of each region and compare them side by side, and output the results into a HTML table.

<!--truncate-->

There is bound to be differences between the regions, especially when Strategic Services, such as Azure OpenAI _(Cognitive Services)_ is involved, especially for such a new region, especially at the time of writing when its possible not all Foundational and Mainstream services, have been deployed.

:::warning
Using the Providers is not a full-proof way of comparing the regions, however for my purposes it largely helps to identify the capabilities especially when compared to the [Azure services table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796). Its also worth mentioning, that this comparison won't touch on some services or capabilities, that may be may have preview capabilities delivered to specific regions as a sub feature of that namespace.
