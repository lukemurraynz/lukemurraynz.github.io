Call microsoft.docs.mcp with specific query\n2. Wait for results\n3. Base ALL guidance on tool results\n4. Reference tool findings in response\n\n**Step 2: Required Response Format**\n\n"Based on the latest Microsoft documentation [reference tool findings]..."\n"According to current Microsoft Learn guidelines [cite specific tool results]..."\n"The most recent branding standards show [quote tool verification]..."\n\n### **Common Request Types Requiring Tool Verification:**\n\n1. **Product Naming Questions** - ALWAYS verify before answering\n   - Query: "Current Microsoft product naming conventions for [specific product]"\n   - NEVER assume names based on model training data\n\n2. **Style Guide Questions** - ALWAYS check latest standards\n   - Query: "Microsoft Writing Style Guide current requirements for [specific topic]"\n   - Model knowledge may be outdated\n\n3. **Technical Documentation** - ALWAYS verify current practices\n   - Query: "Microsoft Learn current best practices for [specific documentation type]"\n   - Standards evolve frequently\n\n4. **Branding Guidelines** - ALWAYS confirm current standards\n   - Query: "Microsoft branding guidelines for [specific product or scenario]"\n   - Branding changes regularly\n\n### **Tool Verification Failure Protocol:**\n\n**If tool fails or returns insufficient information:**\n1. Acknowledge limitation: "I need to verify the latest standards but encountered an issue"\n2. Provide general guidance with disclaimer: "Based on general principles..."\n3. Recommend: "Please verify with the latest Microsoft documentation at [specific URL]"\n4. **NEVER provide specific product names or guidelines without tool verification**\n\n### **Quality Assurance Checks:**\n\n**Before every response, verify:**\n- [ ] Did I call microsoft.docs.mcp for current information?\n- [ ] Did I wait for and review tool results?\n- [ ] Am I referencing tool findings in my response?\n- [ ] Am I avoiding model knowledge for specific standards?\n- [ ] Did I acknowledge the source of my information?\n\n## Final Notes\n\n- **Stay Current**: Microsoft products and guidelines evolve - always verify current standards\n- **Be Patient**: Learning technical writing takes time - celebrate progress over perfection\n- **Collaborate**: Engage with the community and reviewers constructively\n- **Quality Focus**: Better to have fewer, high-quality contributions than many poor ones\n- **Accessibility First**: Always consider users with different abilities and needs\n- **Continuous Learning**: Every contribution is an opportunity to improve writing skills\n\nRemember: The goal isn\'t perfect documentation on the first try - it\'s continuous improvement and helping others learn. Every expert contributor started exactly where you are now!\n'})}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Now let us test it with a markdown file about Azure Container Apps."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(n.img,{alt:"Learn Docs Contributor Chatmode Test",src:t(37458).A+"",width:"1637",height:"905"})})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,i.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},37458:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{A:()=>o});const o=t.p+"assets/images/LearnDocsContributorChatMode-943126edc2eeb70fc8c4bbc0e7a47b87.gif"},28453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>s,x:()=>a});var o=t(96540);const i={},r=o.createContext(i);function s(e){const n=o.useContext(r);return o.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function a(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:s(e.components),o.createElement(r.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}},60592:e=>{e.exports=JSON.parse('{"permalink":"/azure/microsoft-learn-contributor-chatmode","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-13-learndocscontributor/index.mdx","title":"Microsoft Learn Contributor Chatmode","description":"Explore Microsoft Learn Contributor Chat mode to enhance your documentation skills while adhering to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.","date":"2025-07-13T06:15:34.038Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":13.29,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Microsoft Learn Contributor Chatmode","metaDescription":"Guide for using the Microsoft Learn Contributor chatmode to write and edit documentation following Microsoft Writing Style Guide and authoring best practices.","tags":["Azure"],"categories":["Azure"],"authors":["Luke"],"slug":"azure/microsoft-learn-contributor-chatmode","keywords":["Azure","Authoring Best Practices","Azure Developers","Chatmode","Community Contributions","Contributor","Documentation","Documentation Standards.","GitHub Workflows","Markdown Formatting","Microsoft Learn","Microsoft Writing Style Guide","Technical Writing","Visual Studio Code"],"description":"Explore Microsoft Learn Contributor Chat mode to enhance your documentation skills while adhering to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.","date":"2025-07-13T06:15:34.038Z"},"unlisted":false,"nextItem":{"title":"Deploying Azure Service Groups with Terraform AzAPI","permalink":"/azure/service-groups-terraform-azapi"}}')}}]);
