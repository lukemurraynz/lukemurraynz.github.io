This post will cover some technical implementation considerations for creating a sandbox environment in Azure, that could be used for your own Hackathons using Terraform, Entra ID Access packages and GitHub Actions.\\n\\n{/*truncate*/}\\n\\n![Microsoft Azure - Hackathon](images/hackathon_overview.png)\\n\\nSo let us look at a scenario:\\n\\n> \\"As a hackthon organizer, I want to build an Azure environment that supports various AI-driven solutions aimed at automating and enhancing operational processes, including customer feedback analysis, testing plan creation, and standard procedure refinement.\\"\\n\\n![Hackathon - Requirements](images/hackathon_requirements.PNG)\\n\\nWe have a few Technical Requirements:\\n\\n* Needs to support multiple _(external)_ users and teams from different organisations using Work and Personal accounts, who work as a team.\\n* Needs to support the creation of multiple Azure resources\\n\\nAnd our limitations are:\\n\\n* One Azure subscription\\n\\nLet us look at how we can leverage Microsoft Azure technologies, to implement this.\\n\\n![Hackathon - Azure environment](images/hackathon_environmenttech.PNG)\\n\\n* Azure subscription\\n* [Azure Resource Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#resource-groups) _(within Azure subscription)_\\n* [Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/whatis?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Entra ID Identity Governance - Access Packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796). This requires a Entra ID P2 license.\\n\\nFor the purposes of this article, there are some assumptions, I will be making such as:\\n\\n* A Resource Group per Team, is sufficient for the Hackathon.\\n\\n![Hackathon - Environment concepts](images/hackathon_environmentconcepts.PNG)\\n\\nWe will look at approaching this, as a [Lightly Managed Sandbox](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/microsoft-azure-sandbox-design-considerations/).\\n\\n![Hackathon - Sandbox Types](images/hackathon_sandboxtypes.PNG)\\n\\nAnd give External Identites, access to an Azure subscription, through Access Packages and a Group with Contributor role assigned to the individual Resource Groups.\\n\\n![Hackathon - Identity & Access](images/hackathon_identityaccess.PNG)\\n\\nTo do this, we will leverage Access packages, to invite the external users into the Hackathon tenancy, and assign them to a group that has the Contributor role assigned to the Resource Group.\\n\\n![Hackthon - Access packages](images/hackathon_identityaccesspackages.PNG)\\n\\nBy creating a Policy, allowing External organisations, to request. This will allow the Hackathon Organiser to invite external users, to the Azure subscription, and access internal _(Hackathon)_ resources.\\n\\n![Hackathon - Identity Access packages](images/hackathon_identityaccesspackagespolicy.PNG)\\n![Hackathon - Identity Access packages](images/hackathon_identityaccesspackagespolicy1.PNG)\\n\\n![Hackathon - Identity Access packages](images/hackathonaccesspackage_signup.gif)\\n\\n> You may also need to consider [Inbound Cross-tenant Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/external-id/cross-tenant-access-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) setting Trust configuration.\\n\\n![Hackathon - Cross tenant Access Settings](images/hackathon_identityaccesstrustsettings.PNG)\\n\\nSo lets take a look at some of the main Terraform code snippets that could be used to create the Azure resources for the Hackathon.\\n\\n:::info\\nThe identity, being used to create these Terraform resources will need:\\n\\n* Owner to the Azure Subscription, to create the Resource Groups and role assignments.\\n* [Identity Governance Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#identity-governance-administrator), to create the Access Packages and Catalog.\\n* [Groups Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#groups-administrator) role to create and delete the Groups in the Entra ID tenant.\\n:::\\n\\n```hcl\\nlocals {\\n  # Read the content of the CSV file named \\"az_hackathon.csv\\" and store it in the local variable \\"csv_content\\".\\n  csv_content = file(\\"az_hackathon.csv\\")\\n  # Decode the CSV content into a list of maps, where each map represents a row in the CSV file.\\n  csv_data    = csvdecode(local.csv_content)\\n}\\n```\\nWhat this does is read a CSV file, that contains the details of the Azure Resource Groups that need to be created for the Hackathon, here is a base CSV file that I have used.\\n\\n```csv\\nTeam,Location,Environment,Application,Notes\\nTeam1,AustraliaEast,hackathon,AI,\\"AI Hackathon for luke.geek.nz.\\"\\nTeam2,canadaeast,hackathon,AI,\\"AI Hackathon for luke.geek.nz.\\"\\nTeam3,francecentral,hackathon,AI,\\"AI Hackathon for luke.geek.nz.\\"\\nTeam4,swedencentral,hackathon,AI,\\"AI Hackathon for luke.geek.nz.\\"\\nTeam5,uksouth,hackathon,AI,\\"AI Hackathon for luke.geek.nz.\\"\\n```\\n\\nUsing this, and the [AzureRM](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest) Terraform provider. We can create the Resource Groups, and assign the Access Packages to the Resource Groups.\\n\\n```hcl\\n# Define an Azure Resource Group resource named \\"rg\\".\\nresource \\"azurerm_resource_group\\" \\"rg\\" {\\n  # Create one resource group for each entry in the csv_data list.\\n  count    = length(local.csv_data)\\n    # Set the name of the resource group using the Team, Environment, and Application attributes from the csv_data list.\\n  name     = lower(format(\\"%s-%s-%s-rg\\", local.csv_data[count.index].Team, local.csv_data[count.index].Environment, local.csv_data[count.index].Application))\\n    # Set the location of the resource group using the Location attribute from the csv_data list.\\n  location = local.csv_data[count.index].Location\\n    # Set tags for the resource group using attributes from the csv_data list.\\n  tags = {\\n    Environment = lower(local.csv_data[count.index].Environment)\\n    Team        = lower(local.csv_data[count.index].Team)\\n    Application = lower(local.csv_data[count.index].Application)\\n    Notes       = lower(local.csv_data[count.index].Notes)\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou will create a Resource Group such as below, for each team based on the CSV file:\\n\\n![Hackathon - Resource Group 1](images/hackathon_team1_resourcegroupbeforeOpenAI.png)\\n\\nNow we can create the Groups, and assign the permissions:\\n\\n```hcl\\n# Define an Azure AD Group resource named \\"ad_group\\".\\nresource \\"azuread_group\\" \\"ad_group\\" {\\n  # Create one Azure AD group for each entry in the csv_data list.\\n  count            = length(local.csv_data)\\n  # Set the display name of the Azure AD group using the Team, Environment, and Application attributes from the csv_data list.\\n  display_name     = lower(format(\\"%s-%s-%s-group\\", local.csv_data[count.index].Team, local.csv_data[count.index].Environment, local.csv_data[count.index].Application))\\n  # Set the description of the Azure AD group using the Team, Environment, and Application attributes from the csv_data list.\\n  description      = format(\\"Group for %s environment of %s application managed by %s team.\\", title(local.csv_data[count.index].Environment), title(local.csv_data[count.index].Application), title(local.csv_data[count.index].Team))\\n  # Disable mail for the Azure AD group.\\n  mail_enabled     = false\\n  # Enable security for the Azure AD group.\\n  security_enabled = true\\n}\\n\\n# Define an Azure Role Assignment resource named \\"role_assignment\\".\\nresource \\"azurerm_role_assignment\\" \\"role_assignment\\" {\\n  # Create one role assignment for each entry in the csv_data list.\\n  count                = length(local.csv_data)\\n  # Set the scope of the role assignment to the ID of the corresponding resource group.\\n  scope                = azurerm_resource_group.rg[count.index].id\\n  # Assign the \\"Owner\\" role to the principal.\\n  role_definition_name = \\"Owner\\"\\n  # Set the principal ID to the object ID of the corresponding Azure AD group.\\n  principal_id         = azuread_group.ad_group[count.index].object_id\\n}\\n```\\n\\n![Hackathon - Resource Group Access Control (IAM)](images/hackathon_team1_resourcegroupiam.png)\'\\n\\nSo now, we have created the Resource Groups, Entra ID groups and assigned Owner permissions to the Resource Groups, for each Team in the CSV file, its time to deploy a base resource - such as Azure OpenAI, which those hackathon teams can use, to get going! [Azure OpenAI models are deployed to various regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), and have token limits, constrained to the region, so we need to consider how heavily these endpoints will be hit - which is why you may have noticed in the CSV, that the location of each Resource Group is different, so we want to use that to make sure that our Azure OpenAI resources are deployed in the same region as the Resource Group, to help balance.\\n\\n```hcl\\n# This resource block defines an Azure Cognitive Account resource named \\"openai\\"\\nresource \\"azurerm_cognitive_account\\" \\"openai\\" {\\n  # The for_each argument is used to iterate over a map created from local.csv_data.\\n  # Each entry in the map is identified by an index (idx) and its corresponding value (val).\\n  for_each = { for idx, val in local.csv_data : idx => val }\\n  # The name of the cognitive account is dynamically set using the \\"Team\\" attribute from each value in the map.\\n  name = \\"openai-ca-${lower(each.value.Team)}-${lower(each.value.Location)}\\"\\n  # The location of the cognitive account is set using the \\"Location\\" attribute from each value in the map.\\n  location = each.value.Location\\n  # The resource group name is dynamically set using the key from the map.\\n  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg[each.key].name\\n  # The kind of cognitive account is set to \\"OpenAI\\".\\n  kind = \\"OpenAI\\"\\n  # The SKU (pricing tier) of the cognitive account is set to \\"S0\\".\\n  sku_name = \\"S0\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nSo we end up with something like this:\\n\\n![Hackathon - Azure OpenAI](images/hackathon_resources_AzureOpenAI.png)\\n\\nWe may also need to consider the Azure [Resource Providers](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), as the Hackathon teams, won\'t have permissions to register these.\\n\\nSo we can create a map of the Resource Providers, and then iterate over them, to register them.\\n\\n```hcl\\nvariable \\"resource_providers\\" {\\n  description = \\"Map of Azure resource providers to register\\"\\n  default = {\\n    \\"Microsoft.Maps\\"                    = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.OperationalInsights\\"     = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.EventGrid\\"               = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.EventHub\\"                = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.GuestConfiguration\\"      = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.HDInsight\\"               = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.KeyVault\\"                = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.ContainerService\\"        = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.DBforMySQL\\"              = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.DBforMariaDB\\"            = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.DBforMySQL\\"              = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL\\"         = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.DataFactory\\"             = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.HealthBot\\"               = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.HealthModel\\"             = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.HealthcareApis\\"          = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.MachineLearning\\"         = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.Orbital\\"                 = {}\\n    \\"Microsoft.Sql\\"                     = {}\\n    // Add the rest of your providers here\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nresource \\"azurerm_resource_provider_registration\\" \\"resourceproviders\\" {\\n  for_each = var.resource_providers\\n  name     = each.key\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow, we need to create our Entra ID Catalog and Access Packages, and assign the Resource Groups to the Access package.\\n\\n:::warning\\nThe [request policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#create-request-policies) themselves, I had issues deploying via Terraform, I suspect due to missing Graph permissions \'EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All\' on the identity, but had some issues adding this, so did them manually, however have successfully deployed the policies in another environment sucessfully using the: [azuread_access_package_assignment_policy](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azuread/latest/docs/resources/access_package_assignment_policy) terraform resource. \\n\\nMake sure you add:\\nrequests_accepted = true\\nTo the requestors block, to enable the policy, or the policy will be deployed as Disabled.\\n:::\\n  \\n  ```hcl\\nresource \\"azuread_access_package_catalog\\" \\"Sandbox\\" {\\n  description  = \\"Hackathon Sandboxes\\"\\n  display_name = \\"Sandbox\\"\\n  published    = true\\n}\\n\\n# Define an Azure AD Access Package resource named \\"access_package\\"\\nresource \\"azuread_access_package\\" \\"access_package\\" {\\n  #

It is a simple and comprehensive scanner that can be used to scan images for vulnerabilities in the OS packages, application dependencies, and language-specific packages, supplemented by vulnerability databases supplemented with Copa, which can be used to patch the vulnerabilities found by Trivy; this tool can be used to quickly patch container images without going upstream for a full rebuild, which may require more time, and the involvement of multiple teams _(ie Developers, Q&A, Operations, Support)_ to patch, test and deploy.\\n\\nIn this article, we will use [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) to run a pipeline that will use [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/) to scan a container image for vulnerabilities, and then use [Copa](https://project-copacetic.github.io/copacetic/website/) to patch the vulnerabilities found by Trivy, and then push the patched image to an [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/container-registry?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n{/* truncate */}\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccbOverview\\n\\n:::info\\n[Copa](https://github.com/project-copacetic/copacetic) gives the ability to patch containers quickly without going upstream for a complete rebuild. As the window between [vulnerability disclosure and active exploitation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-scan-for-vulnerabilities-within-15-minutes-of-disclosure/) continues to narrow, there is a growing operational need to patch critical security vulnerabilities in container images so they can be quickly redeployed into production.\\n\\nIn addition to filling the operational gap not met by left-shift security practices and tools, the ability of Copa to patch a container without requiring a rebuild of the container image provides other benefits:\\n\\n![Container image patching](direct-image-patching.png)\\n\\n* Allows users other than the image publishers also to patch container images, such as DevSecOps engineers.\\n* Reduces the storage and transmission costs of redistributing patched images by only creating an additional patch layer instead of rebuilding the entire image, which usually results in different layer hashes that break layer caching.\\n* Reduces the turnaround time for patching a container image by not having to wait for base image updates and being a faster operation than a full image rebuild.\\n* Reduces the complexity of patching the image from running a rebuild pipeline to running a single tool on the image.\\n:::\\n\\n:::warning\\nCopa currently only supports OS package vulnerabilities and does not support application dependencies or language-specific packages. When validated and tested with developers, it is recommended to use Copa in conjunction with Trivy to patch OS package vulnerabilities and other tools to patch application dependencies and language-specific packages.\\n:::\\n\\n:::info\\nThe copa tool is an extensible engine that:\\n\\nParses the needed update packages from the container image\u2019s vulnerability report produced by a scanner like Trivy. New adapters can be written to accommodate more report formats.\\nObtains and processes the needed update packages using the appropriate package manager tools such as apt, apk, etc. New adapters can be written to support more package managers.\\nApplies the resulting update binaries to the container image using buildkit.\\n\\n![Copa](vulnerability-patch.png)\\n\\nThis approach is motivated by the core principles of making direct container patching broadly applicable and accessible:\\n\\n* Copa supports patching existing container images _(Devs don\'t need to build their images using specific tools or modify them in some way to support container patching)_.\\n* Copa supports containers without package managers, including distro less containers\\n* Copa works with the existing vulnerability scanning and mitigation ecosystems.\\n_(Image publishers don\'t need to create new workflows for container patching since Copa supports patching container images using the security update packages already being published today.)_\\n_(Consumers do not need to migrate to a new and potentially more limited support ecosystem for custom distros or change their container vulnerability scanning pipelines to include remediation since Copa can be integrated seamlessly as an extra step to patch containers based on those scanning reports.)_\\n* Copa reduces the technical expertise needed and waiting on dependencies needed to patch an image.\\n_(For OS package vulnerabilities, no specialized knowledge about a specific image is needed to be patch it as Copa relies on the vulnerability remediation knowledge already embedded in the reports produced by popular container scanning tools today.)_\\n:::\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80Azure DevOps deploy\\n\\nSo let\'s get started by creating a new Azure DevOps pipeline that will use Trivy to scan a container image for vulnerabilities, and then use Copa to patch the vulnerabilities found by Trivy, and then push the patched image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR).\\n\\nFirst we need to create the Service Connection, we can create a [Docker Registry service connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/containers/publish-to-acr?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n![Create Service Connection](docker-registry-acr-serviceconnection.png)\\n\\nThen, we can use the pipeline to connect to the Container Registry and patch the Container.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD\\n  A[Start] --\x3e B{Parameters}\\n  B --\x3e C{Variables}\\n  C --\x3e D[Stages]\\n  D --\x3e E[Stage: Patch]\\n  E --\x3e F[Job: Copacetic]\\n  F --\x3e G[Step: Setup]\\n  G --\x3e H[Step: Scan and Patch Image]\\n  H --\x3e I[Step: Upload Results]\\n  I --\x3e J[Step: Push Patched Image to ACR]\\n  J --\x3e K[End]\\n```\\n\\nMake sure you update the parameters, and Service Principal variable name with the up-to-date versions of Trivy, Copacetic and BuildKit, at the time you run this, and of course the container image you want to patch.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0fPipeline\\n\\nYou can also find the full pipeline code at the following gist: [lukemurraynz/copacetic.yml](https://gist.github.com/lukemurraynz/ea00bc9c6b6a9468a82f3b679c40a220).\\n\\n```yaml copacetic.yml\\n# The name of the pipeline, including the date and a revision number\\nname: copa_$(Date:yyyyMMdd)_$(Rev:r)\\n\\n# This pipeline is not triggered automatically by any event\\ntrigger: none\\n\\n# This pipeline is not triggered automatically by any pull request\\npr: none\\n\\n# Parameters for the pipeline\\nparameters:\\n  # The Docker image to be patched\\n  # This parameter specifies the Docker image that will be patched by the pipeline.\\n  - name: image\\n    displayName: Image To Patch\\n    type: string\\n    default: \\"azcontainerregistry.azurecr.io/api-firewall:0.6.14\\"\\n\\n  # The version of Trivy to be used\\n  # Trivy is a Simple and Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanner for Containers and other Artifacts,\\n  # suitable for CI.

You can drop all traffic that reaches the Azure Application Gateway with an /internal URL by routing it to a backend that doesn\'t exist.\\n\\nTo do this, you can create a Backend Pool named sinkhole and a Rule to route traffic to the sinkhole pool based on the path using the Application Gateway path routing rules.\\n\\n![Azure App Gateway - Sinkhole](appgw_routingrules_sinkhole.png)\\n\\nHere is the Terraform code on how you might implement this:\\n\\n```hcl\\n# Public/external gateway rules\\n  url_path_map {\\n    name = \\"path-based-routing\\"\\n\\n    default_backend_address_pool_name  = \\"apim\\"\\n    default_backend_http_settings_name = \\"int-https-settings-gateway\\"\\n\\n    path_rule {\\n      name                       = \\"externalPathRule\\"\\n      paths                      = [\\"/external*\\"]\\n      backend_address_pool_name  = \\"apim\\"\\n      backend_http_settings_name = \\"int-https-settings-gateway\\"\\n    }\\n\\n    path_rule {\\n      name                       = \\"internalPathRule\\"\\n      paths                      = [\\"/internal*\\"]\\n      backend_address_pool_name  = \\"sinkhole\\"\\n      backend_http_settings_name = \\"int-https-settings-gateway\\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  request_routing_rule {\\n    name               = \\"request-routing-public-apim-gateway\\"\\n    rule_type          = \\"PathBasedRouting\\"\\n    http_listener_name = \\"https-gateway-public\\"\\n    url_path_map_name  = \\"path-based-routing\\"\\n    priority           = \\"100\\"\\n  }\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis Terraform code is configuring an Azure Application Gateway, which is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications.\\n\\nHere\'s a breakdown of what each section does:\\n\\n* url_path_map: This block defines a URL path-based routing rule. It specifies how HTTP traffic is routed to different backend pools based on the URL paths of the HTTP requests.\\n* default_backend_address_pool_name and default_backend_http_settings_name define the default backend pool and HTTP settings to use if none of the specified path rules match.\\n* Two path_rule blocks are defined. Each path_rule specifies a condition (based on the URL path) and the corresponding backend pool and HTTP settings to use when the condition is met. The first rule routes requests with paths starting with \\"/external\\" to the \\"apim\\" backend pool. The second rule routes requests with paths starting with \\"/internal\\" to the \\"sinkhole\\" backend pool.\\nrequest_routing_rule: This block defines a request routing rule, determining how the Application Gateway distributes traffic to the backend pools.\\n* rule_type is set to \\"PathBasedRouting,\\" which means the rule is based on URL paths.\\n* http_listener_name specifies the HTTP listener to associate with the rule.\\n\\nurl_path_map_name specifies the URL path map to use, which is defined in the url_path_map block.\\n\\nPriority sets the priority of the rule. Lower numbers have higher priority. If a request matches multiple rules, the rule with the highest priority is applied.\\n\\nSo let us look at the sinkhole configuration:\\n\\n```hcl\\n  backend_address_pool {\\n    name  = \\"sinkhole\\"\\n    fqdns = null\\n  }\\n```\\n\\nHere\'s a breakdown of what each line does:\\n\\n* backend_address_pool: This block defines a backend address pool, which is a collection of IP addresses to which the Application Gateway can route network traffic.\\n* \\"sinkhole\\": This line sets the name of the backend address pool to \\"sinkhole.\\" This name is used to reference the backend address pool in other parts of the configuration.\\n* fqdns = null: This line sets the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) of the backend addresses to null. This means that the backend address pool does not contain any backend addresses. In the context of a \\"sinkhole\\" pool, this is likely intended to discard traffic or direct it to a non-existent endpoint.\\n\\nI hope this helps you understand how to configure a sinkhole pool in Azure Application Gateway using Terraform. This allows you to offer both external and internal APIs through the gateway. You can also have a private listener with a different routing rile if you want to offer all the internal and external APIs to your internal consumers/networks.\\n\\n\ud83d\udcd6 References: \\n\\n- \ud83d\udd17[Deploy your Azure API Management instance to a virtual network - internal mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-using-with-internal-vnet?tabs=stv2&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n- \ud83d\udd17[Protect APIs with Application Gateway and API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/web-apps/api-management/architectures/protect-apis?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n- \ud83d\udd17[URL Path Based Routing overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/url-route-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n- \ud83d\udd17[apim-landing-zone-accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/apim-landing-zone-accelerator)"},{"id":"azure/proactive-resiliency-assessment","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/proactive-resiliency-assessment","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-06-reliability-assessment/index.mdx","title":"Running your own Azure Proactive Resiliency Assessment","description":"Detailed guide on setting up an Azure Proactive Resiliency Assessment.","date":"2024-07-06T10:43:07.165Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":10.65,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Running your own Azure Proactive Resiliency Assessment","metaDescription":"Detailed guide on setting up an Azure Proactive Resiliency Assessment.","date":"2024-07-06T10:43:07.165Z","tags":["Azure"],"categories":["Azure"],"authors":["Luke"],"slug":"azure/proactive-resiliency-assessment","keywords":["mission-critical","Azure","Proactive Resiliency","Assessment","Cloud Reliability","Best Practices","Cloud Reliability","Best Practices"],"description":"Detailed guide on setting up an Azure Proactive Resiliency Assessment."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Azure App Gateway Sinkhole for API Management with Terraform","permalink":"/azure/application-gateway-apim-sinkhole-terraform"},"nextItem":{"title":"Infrastructure as Code GitHub Codespace Template","permalink":"/azure/iac-github-codespace"}},"content":"The [Azure Proactive Resiliency Library](https://azure.github.io/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2/) is a curated collection of best practices, guidance, and recommendations designed to improve the resiliency of applications and services running in Azure.

Please contact your local Microsoft contact for information about their Resiliency workshop and the full delivery.\\n\\n![Azure Proactive Resiliency Library - Assessment](AzProactiveResiliencyLibrary_Assessment.png)\\n\\n> So, why must we consider reliability and resiliency in our Azure workloads?\\n\\nThe answer is simple: ensure that your applications and services are available and reliable, even when failures occur. This is important for business continuity and ensuring that your customers can access your services when needed.\\n\\n![Azure Proactive Resiliency Library - Importance of realibility](AzProactiveResiliencyLibrary_ImportanceRealiability.png)\\n\\nWhen managing resources and workloads in Azure, ensuring reliability is paramount to avoid unexpected failures and downtime. But why exactly do bad things happen, even when there seem to be numerous safeguards in place? Let\'s delve into reliability and why it\'s essential for your Azure environment by exploring the \\"Swiss Cheese Model\\" of accident causation, illustrated in the image above.\\n\\nThe [Swiss Cheese Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model), developed by James Reason, is a popular way to understand how errors and failures occur in complex systems. Each defense layer\u2014represented as Swiss cheese slices\u2014has holes or weaknesses. When these holes align across multiple layers, an accident can occur. Let\'s break down this model and see how it applies to Azure reliability.\\n\\n* Institutional Level: Institutions may need more procedures and regulatory narrowness at the highest level. In the context of Azure, this could mean inadequate governance policies or a lack of compliance with best practices. These gaps can create vulnerabilities that might be exploited, leading to system failures.\\n* Organizational Level: Organizations often face mixed messages and production pressures. This could translate to conflicting priorities for Azure between rapid deployment and maintaining robust security and reliability. Pressure to deliver quickly might lead to overlooked reliability checks, creating potential points of failure.\\n* Professional Level: Issues such as responsibility shifting can arise at the professional level. In an Azure environment, this might occur when there is a lack of clear ownership over different architecture components, leading to neglected maintenance and updates.\\n* Team Level: Teams might suffer from inadequate training. In Azure, this could mean insufficient knowledge about Azure services, leading to suboptimal configuration and resource management. Proper training ensures that teams can effectively manage and troubleshoot their environments.\\n* Individual Level: Individual contributors might be distracted or make errors. In Azure, this could involve misconfigurations or overlooking critical logs and alerts. Encouraging a culture of attention to detail and thoroughness can help mitigate these risks.\\n* Technical Level: Finally, technical issues such as clumsy technology, coding bugs, and deferred maintenance can directly impact reliability; in Azure, this might involve outdated software versions, unpatched vulnerabilities, or inefficient resource configurations.\\n\\nBy understanding the layers of defense and potential triggers for failures, you can take proactive steps to enhance the reliability of your Azure resources and workloads, ensuring a robust, secure, and efficient cloud environment.\\n\\nThe Azure Proactive Resiliency library and the assessments we will run through will concentrate on the technical level to ensure that your Azure resources are configured correctly and are resilient to failures; however, the other layers of defense are also essential to consider and are a [shared responsibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/reliability/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#reliability-requirements) between Microsoft and the customer.\\n\\n![Azure Proactive Resiliency Library - shared responsibility](AzProactiveResiliencyLibrary_SharedResponsibility.png)\\n\\nSo - let us get started with the Azure Proactive Resiliency Library and the assessment report.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcca Create Resiliency Reports\\n\\nThe Assessment report is a 3 stage process.\\n\\n1. collect the data\\n2. analyse the data\\n3. create the report\\n\\n![Azure Proactive Resiliency Library - Assessment report](AzProactiveResiliencyLibrary_AssessmentProcess.png)\\n\\n> You can do both the data collection in an Azure CloudShell, which is useful for running this in customer environments; however, to create and analyze the data, you must run the script from a computer with Word and Excel installed.\\n\\n**It is worth noting that not all services will be supported by the automated resource graph queries, so you will need to check any services that are not supported manually, and when looking at running this for Production workloads, remember to consider the business context around the resiliency requirements.**\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcca Collect the data\\n\\nThe Collector PowerShell script is designed to collect data from the Azure environment to help identify potential issues and areas for improvement using the Azure Resource Graph queries within this repository.\\n\\n| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                              | Example                                                                    |\\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| TenantID          | Optional: tenant to be used.                                                                                             | 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012                                       |\\n| SubscriptionIds   | Required (or SubscriptionsFile): Specifies Subscription(s) to be included in the analysis.                               | 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012, 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 |\\n| SubscriptionsFile | Optional (or SubscriptionIds): Specifies the file with the list to be analyzed (one subscription per line). | subscriptions.txt                                                          |\\n| RunbookFile       | Optional: Specifies the file with the runbook (selectors & checks) for use.                                           | runbook.json                                                               |\\n| ResourceGroups    | Optional: Specifies Resource Group(s) to be included in the analysis.                                                    | ResourceGroup1,ResourceGroup2                                              |\\n| Debug             | Optional: Writes debugging information for the script during the execution.                                               | TRUE                                                                       |\\n\\n\\n1.

They are templates that can be applied to solve a problem in a specific context. They are not finished designs that can be transformed directly into code. They are a starting point for your design.\\n\\n![Design Patterns](Blog_CloudDesignPattnerns_Importance.gif)\\n\\n:::info\\nDesign patterns are not new. They have been around for a long time. The concept of design patterns was introduced by the architect [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander#:~:text=Alexander%%20and%20personally%20built,architect%20and%20a%20general%20contractor.&text=In%20software%2C%20Alexander%20is%20regarded,to%20its%20creator%2C%20Ward%20Cunningham) in the field of architecture and later adopted by software engineers.\\n:::\\n\\nDesign patterns are essential to consider when implementing your solutions as they help with the following:\\n\\nReusability - Design patterns promote reusability by providing proven solutions to common problems, allowing components and subsystems to be used in other applications and scenarios and interoperability\\n\\n* Maintainability - They simplify administration and development, making maintaining and updating applications easier.\\n* Consistency - Design patterns ensure consistency and coherence in component design and deployment, which is crucial for the overall quality of the application\\n* Efficiency - By following established patterns, developers can avoid repetitive work and focus on implementing specific requirements, thus saving development time\\n* Scalability - Design patterns help in designing scalable systems by providing guidelines for efficient resource allocation and management\\n* Performance - They help optimize the use of system resources, leading to improved performance of the application\xa0\\n* Modularity - Design patterns promote modular and structured code, making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain.\\n\\nThis is as true in Modern Cloud solutions as it is in traditional development, with [well-architected principles](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/well-architected/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) more important than ever.\\n\\nTake a Cloud Platform or ecosystem like Azure, with Services offering a theory of functionality that can be put together like Lego bricks.\\n\\n* Scalability\u2014Cloud design patterns address scalability by providing solutions for horizontal and vertical scaling, ensuring that applications can handle increased loads efficiently. This promotes sustainability by enabling dynamic resource allocation and reducing energy consumption during low-demand periods.\\n* Resilience\u2014Patterns like Circuit Breakers and Bulkhead help build resilient applications that can withstand failures and continue to function. Sustainable operations are achieved by minimizing downtime and resource wastage, thus ensuring efficient resource use.\\n* Security\u2014Security patterns such as API Gateway and Secure Token ensure that applications are protected against malicious actors while maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Secure systems support sustainability by preventing security breaches that could lead to resource wastage.\\n* Operational Excellence - Patterns like Ambassador and Anti-Corruption Layer enhance operational excellence by simplifying the management and monitoring of cloud applications. Efficient management practices contribute to sustainability by optimizing resource usage and reducing unnecessary overhead.\\n* Performance Efficiency - Patterns such as Cache-Aside and Compute Resource Consolidation optimize performance by efficiently managing resources and reducing latency. Effective resource management leads to sustainability by lowering the overall resource footprint and energy consumption.\\n* Data Management\u2014Data management patterns address data consistency, synchronization, and management challenges across different locations, which is crucial for cloud applications. Sustainable data practices ensure data is stored and processed efficiently, minimizing energy use and reducing environmental impact.\\n\\n#### Acroymns\\n\\nWhen talking about design patterns, we will be using a few acronyms, and it is important to understand what they mean in order to fully understand the context.\\n\\n| Acronym  | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Service  | A service in cloud pattern design refers to a distinct function or set of functions a cloud application provides. Services are typically designed to be reusable and can be consumed by multiple clients or consumers. | In a microservices architecture, each microservice is a service that performs a specific business function, such as user authentication, payment processing, or data storage.                              |\\n| Consumer | A \xa0consumer is an entity (such as an application, service, or user) that consumes or uses the services provided by another service. Consumers send requests to services and receive responses.                            | A web application that calls an authentication service to verify user credentials is a consumer of that authentication service.                                                                            |\\n| Tenant   | In a multi-tenant architecture, a tenant is a group of users who share common access with specific privileges to the software instance. Each tenant\'s data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.            | In a Software as a Service (SaaS) application, each customer (company or organization) is considered a tenant. They have their own isolated data and configuration settings within the shared application. |\\n| Facade   | The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use and understand. It acts as a high-level interface that hides the complexities of the underlying system.                      | In a software application, a facade can be used to provide a simplified API that abstracts away the complexities of interacting with multiple subsystems or modules.                                      |\\n| Asynchronous | Asynchronous communication is a messaging pattern where the sender and receiver do not need to interact in real time. The sender can send a message and continue with other tasks, while the receiver processes the message at its own pace. | In a distributed system, asynchronous messaging can be used to decouple components and improve scalability. For example, a message queue can be used to send and receive messages between different services. |\\n| Synchronous | Synchronous communication is a messaging pattern where the sender and receiver interact in real time. The sender sends a message and waits for a response from the receiver before proceeding. | In a request-response scenario, a client sends a request to a server and waits for the server to process the request and send back a response. This pattern is commonly used in HTTP-based APIs. |\\n\\n### Archetypes *(Categories)* of Patterns\\n\\nCloud design patterns can be categorized into different Archetypes *(categories)* based on their characteristics and use cases. These archetypes provide a structured way to understand and apply patterns in cloud architecture design.\\n\\nThe categories include Data Management, Security, Reliability, Messaging, and Design and implementation. Let\'s examine each category in detail.\\n\\n* Data Management patterns help us manage data in the cloud. Caching helps us reduce the number of database hits and improve application performance. Sharding helps us partition our data across multiple databases to improve scalability. Federation helps us distribute data across multiple databases for better availability and fault tolerance.\\n* Security patterns help us secure our applications in the cloud. Perimeter Networks help us isolate our applications from the Internet. Identity Management helps us manage user identities and access to resources. Secure Communication helps us protect our data in transit.\\n* Reliability patterns help us build highly available and fault-tolerant applications in the cloud. Retry helps us recover from transient failures. Circuit Breakers help us prevent cascading failure. Bulkhead helps us limit the damage caused by a failure.\\n* Messaging patterns help us build scalable and decoupled applications in the cloud. Asynchronous Messaging helps us send messages between components in a non-blocking way. Event Sourcing helps us capture all changes to an application state. Competing Consumers help us process messages in parallel.\\n* Design and implementation patterns help us build scalable and resilient cloud-native applications. Valet Key helps us delegate access to resources. Ambassador helps us expose services to external clients. Gateway helps us provide a single entry point to our application.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Patterns Archetypes](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_Archetypes.PNG)\\n\\n:::warning\\nAs usual, the choice of pattern depends on your application\'s specific requirements. To make an informed decision, it\'s essential to understand the characteristics and trade-offs of each pattern and business requirements. Sometimes, multiple patterns may be required, or even part of one, to solve a specific problem.\\n:::\\n\\n### Pattern Deep Dives\\n\\nThe cloud has changed the way we design our applications. Let\'s examine some design patterns we can use in the cloud. These patterns help us solve common problems in cloud architecture and make our applications more reliable, scalable, and secure.\\n\\nIn the following sections, we will examine common cloud design patterns, their use cases, and considerations in depth.\\n\\n### Data Management Patterns\\n\\n![Design Patterns - Data Management](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_DataManagement.PNG)\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcda Cache-Aside\\n\\n> Load data on demand into a cache from a data store\\n\\nMany commercial caching systems provide read-through and write-through/write-behind operations. In these systems, an application retrieves data by referencing the cache. \\n\\nIf the data isn\'t in the cache, it\'s retrieved from the data store and added to the cache. Any modifications to data held in the cache are also automatically written back to the data store.\\n\\nFor caches that don\'t provide this functionality, it\'s the responsibility of the applications that use the cache to maintain the data.\\n\\nIf an application updates information, it can follow the write-through strategy by modifying the data store and invalidating the corresponding item in the cache. When the item is next required, using the cache-aside strategy will cause the updated data to be retrieved from the data store and added back into the cache.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Pattern - CacheAsSide](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_CacheAside.gif)\\n\\n#### Issues & considerations\\n\\nConsider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:\\n\\n* Lifetime of cached data. Many caches implement an expiration policy that invalidates data and removes it from the cache if it\'s not accessed for a specified period. For cache-aside to be effective, ensure that the expiration policy matches the pattern of access for applications that use the data. Don\'t make the expiration period too short because this can cause applications to continually retrieve data from the data store and add it to the cache. Similarly, don\'t make the expiration period so long that the cached data will likely become stale. Remember that caching is most effective for relatively static data or data that is read frequently.\\n* Evicting data. Most caches have a limited size compared to the data store where the data originates, and they\'ll evict data if necessary. Most caches adopt a least-recently-used policy for selecting items to evict, but this might be customizable. Configure the global expiration property and other properties of the cache, as well as the expiration property of each cached item, to ensure that the cache is cost-effective. Applying a global eviction policy to every item in the cache isn\'t always appropriate. For example, if a cached item is costly to retrieve from the data store, it can be beneficial to keep this item in the cache at the expense of more frequently accessed but less costly items.\\n* Priming the cache. Many solutions prepopulate the cache with the data that an application is likely to need during startup processing. The Cache-Aside pattern can still be useful if some of this data expires or is evicted.\\n* Consistency. Implementing the Cache-Aside pattern doesn\'t guarantee consistency between the data store and the cache. An external process can change an item in the data store at any time, and this change might not be reflected in the cache until the next time the item is loaded. In a system replicating data across data stores, this problem can become serious if synchronization occurs frequently.\\n* Local *(in-memory)* caching. A cache could be local to an application instance and stored in memory. Cache-aside can be useful in this environment if an application repeatedly accesses the same data. However, a local cache is private, so different application instances could each have a copy of the same cached data. This data could quickly become inconsistent between caches, so it might be necessary to expire data in a private cache and refresh it more frequently. In these scenarios, investigate a shared or distributed caching mechanism.\\n\\n#### When to use this pattern\\n\\n* When an in-built cache doesn\'t provide native read-through or write-back operations.\\n* When resource demand is unpredictable, you want to avoid overloading the data store.\\n* When the cached dataset is not static\\n* When NOT caching session state information in a web application hosted in a web farm. \\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e NoNativeCacheOps{Does the in-built cache not provide native read-through or write-back operations?}\\n  NoNativeCacheOps -- Yes --\x3e UnpredictableDemand{Is resource demand unpredictable?}\\n  NoNativeCacheOps -- No --\x3e DoNotUseCacheAside[Do not use Cache-Aside]\\n  UnpredictableDemand -- Yes --\x3e NonStaticData{Is the cached dataset not static?}\\n  UnpredictableDemand -- No --\x3e DoNotUseCacheAside\\n  NonStaticData -- Yes --\x3e NotCachingSessionState{Are you not caching session state information in a web application hosted in a web farm?}\\n  NonStaticData -- No --\x3e DoNotUseCacheAside\\n  NotCachingSessionState -- Yes --\x3e UseCacheAside[Use Cache-Aside]\\n  NotCachingSessionState -- No --\x3e DoNotUseCacheAside\\n```\\n\\n#### Azure Solutions\\n\\nIn this example, it uses [Azure Cache for Redis](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796). When an application needs to retrieve data, it will first check to see if it exists in Azure Cache for Redis.\\nIf the data is found in Azure Cache for Redis (cache hit), the application will use this data.\\nIf the data is not found in Azure Cache for Redis (cache miss), the application must retrieve it from the appropriate Azure database service.\\nFor cache miss scenarios, the requesting application should add the data retrieved from the Azure Database service to Azure Cache for Redis.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcda Sharding\\n\\n> Divide a data store into a set of horizontal partitions or shards.\\n\\nDividing a data store into a set of horizontal partitions or shards. This can improve scalability when storing and accessing large volumes of data.\\n\\n* The Lookup strategy. In this strategy, the sharding logic implements a map that routes a request for data to the shard containing that data using the shard key. In a multi-tenant application, all the data for a tenant might be stored together in a shard using the tenant ID as the shard key. Multiple tenants might share the same shard, but the data for a single tenant won\'t be spread across multiple shards.\\n* The Range strategy. This strategy groups related items together in the same shard and orders them by shard key\u2014the shard keys are sequential. It\'s useful for applications that frequently retrieve sets of items using range queries (queries that return a set of data items for a shard key that falls within a given range). For example, if an application regularly needs to find all orders placed in a given month, this data can be retrieved more quickly if all orders for a month are stored in date and time order in the same shard. If each order were stored in a different shard, they\'d have to be fetched individually by performing many point queries (queries that return a single data item).\xa0\\n* The Hash strategy. The purpose of this strategy is to reduce the chance of hotspots (shards that receive a disproportionate amount of load). It distributes the data across the shards in a way that achieves a balance between the size of each shard and the average load that each shard will encounter. The sharding logic computes the shard to store an item in based on a hash of one or more data attributes. The chosen hashing function should distribute data evenly across the shards, possibly by introducing some random element into the computation.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Pattern - Sharding](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_Sharding.gif)\\n\\n#### Issues & considerations\\n\\nConsider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:\\n\\n* Balancing data across multiple shards.\\n* Your queries need to be efficient and not require data from multiple shards or cause latency issues.\\n* Designing for scalability (storage nodes \u2013 data & throughput)\\n* Designing for availability (replication, failover, recovery)\\n* Make sure to use stable and unique key data to determine the sharding state\\n* Monitoring, backup, and maintaining consistency of multiple shards can be difficult.\\n\\n#### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe primary focus of sharding is to improve the performance and scalability of a system. Still, as a by-product it can also improve availability due to how the data is divided into separate partitions. A failure in one partition doesn\'t necessarily prevent an application from accessing data held in other partitions, and an operator can perform maintenance or recovery of one or more partitions without making the entire data for an application inaccessible.\xa0\\n\\n* When the data store is likely to need to scale beyond the resources of a single storage node.\\n* When you can improve performance  by reducing contention on a single data store.\\n* When you need to optimize cost by multiple instances of less expensive compute or storage.\\n* Improve resilience and reliability.\\n* When you have geographical concerns, i.e., Optimization based on where users or systems are located.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e IsScaleBeyondSingleNode{Is the data store likely to scale beyond the resources of a single node?}\\n  IsScaleBeyondSingleNode -- Yes --\x3e CanReduceContention{Can performance be improved by reducing contention on a single data store?}\\n  IsScaleBeyondSingleNode -- No --\x3e DoNotUseSharding[Do not use Sharding]\\n  CanReduceContention -- Yes --\x3e CanOptimizeCost{Can cost be optimized by multiple instances of less expensive compute or storage?}\\n  CanReduceContention -- No --\x3e DoNotUseSharding\\n  CanOptimizeCost -- Yes --\x3e NeedToImproveResilience{Need to improve resilience and reliability?}\\n  CanOptimizeCost -- No --\x3e DoNotUseSharding\\n  NeedToImproveResilience -- Yes --\x3e HaveGeographicalConcerns{Have geographical concerns?}\\n  NeedToImproveResilience -- No --\x3e DoNotUseSharding\\n  HaveGeographicalConcerns -- Yes --\x3e UseSharding[Use Sharding]\\n  HaveGeographicalConcerns -- No --\x3e DoNotUseSharding\\n```\\n\\n#### Azure Solutions\\n\\nConsider a website that surfaces an expansive collection of information on published books worldwide. \\nThe number of possible books cataloged in this workload and the typical query/usage patterns contra-indicate the usage of a single relational database to store the book information. The workload architect decides to shard the data across multiple database instances, using the books\' static International Standard Book Number (ISBN) for the shard key. Specifically, they use the\xa0check digit\xa0(0 - 10) of the ISBN as that gives 11 possible logical shards, and the data will be balanced across each shard. First, they decide to colocate the 11 logical shards into three physical shard databases. They use the\xa0lookup\xa0sharding approach and store the key-to-server mapping information in a shard map database.\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-database-paas-overview?view=azuresql&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/introduction?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), and [Azure Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n### \ud83d\ude97 Valet Key\\n\\n> Use a token or key that provides clients with restricted direct access to a specific resource or service.\\n\\nData stores have the ability to handle the upload and download of data directly without requiring the application to perform any processing to move this data. However, this typically requires the client to have access to the store\'s security credentials. This can be a useful technique to minimize data transfer costs and the requirement to scale out the application and to maximize performance. It means, though, that the application is no longer able to manage the security of the data. After the client has a connection to the data store for direct access, the application can\'t act as the gatekeeper. It\'s no longer in control of the process and can\'t prevent subsequent uploads or downloads from the data store.\\nThis isn\'t a realistic approach in distributed systems that need to serve untrusted clients. \\n\\nApplications must be able to securely control access to data in a granular way, but still reduce the load on the server by setting up this connection and then allowing the client to communicate directly with the data store to perform the required read or write operations.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Pattern - Valet Key](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_ValetKey.gif)\\n\\n#### Issues & considerations\\n\\nBy considering these issues and trade-offs, you can effectively implement the Valet Key pattern to enhance security, performance, and cost efficiency in your cloud applications.\\n\\n* Ensure that the token or key used for access is securely generated and transmitted to prevent unauthorized access\\n* It could introduce security and audit risks if not implemented correctly\\n* Implement proper access controls and authorization mechanisms to restrict the actions that can be performed using the valet key\\n* Cost savings from offloading processing must be weighed against the complexity of implementing and managing the Valet Key pattern\\n* Monitor and audit access using the valet key to detect any unauthorized or malicious activities\\n* Ensure that the resources are managed efficiently to avoid unnecessary costs, especially when dealing with frequent or large client requests\\n\\n#### When to use this pattern\\n\\nUsing a valet key doesn\'t require the resource to be locked, no remote server call is required, there\'s no limit on the number of valet keys that can be issued, and it avoids a single point of failure resulting from performing the data transfer through the application code.\xa0\\n\\nConsider using the Valet Key pattern in the following scenarios:\\n\\n* Offload data transfer from the application to minimize the use of valuable resources such as computing, memory, and bandwidth. \\n* When the data is stored in a remote data store or a different datacenter from the application.\\n* Minimize operational costs by enabling direct access to stores and queues. \\n* Clients regularly upload or download data, particularly where there\'s a large volume or when each operation involves a large file\\n* If the application doesn\u2019t need to perform tasks on the data first.\\n* When you need to provide secure, temporary access to specific resources or services.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e OffloadDataTransfer{Offload data transfer to minimize resource usage?}\\n  OffloadDataTransfer -- Yes --\x3e RemoteDataStore{Is data stored remotely or in a different datacenter?}\\n  OffloadDataTransfer -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use this pattern]\\n  RemoteDataStore -- Yes --\x3e MinimizeCosts{Minimize operational costs by direct access to stores and queues?}\\n  RemoteDataStore -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  MinimizeCosts -- Yes --\x3e RegularDataTransfer{Clients regularly upload or download large volumes of data?}\\n  MinimizeCosts -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  RegularDataTransfer -- Yes --\x3e NoDataProcessing{Application doesn\u2019t need to process the data first?}\\n  RegularDataTransfer -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  NoDataProcessing -- Yes --\x3e SecureAccess{Need to provide secure, temporary access to resources?}\\n  NoDataProcessing -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  SecureAccess -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use this pattern]\\n  SecureAccess -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n```\\n\\n#### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure supports shared access signatures on Azure Storage for granular access control to data in blobs, tables, and queues, and for Service Bus queues and topics. A shared access signature token can be configured to provide specific access rights such as read, write, update, and delete to a specific table, a key range within a table, a queue, a blob, or a blob container. The validity can be a specified time period. This functionality is well-suited for accessing a valet key.\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and [Azure Function](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n### \ud83d\udce6 Static Content Hosting\\n\\n> Deploy static content to a cloud-based storage service that can deliver them directly to the client.\\n\\nWeb applications typically include some elements of static content. This static content might include HTML pages and other resources such as images and documents that are available to the client, either as part of an HTML page (such as inline images, style sheets, and client-side JavaScript files) or as separate downloads (such as PDF documents).\\nAlthough web servers are optimized for dynamic rendering and output caching, they still have to handle requests to download static content. This consumes processing cycles that could often be better used for more important delivery and user-experience tasks.\\n\\nDeploy static content to a cloud-based storage service that can deliver them directly to the client. This can reduce the need for potentially expensive compute instances.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Pattern - StaticContent](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_StaticContent.gif)\\n\\n#### Issues & considerations\\n\\nBy considering these issues and trade-offs, you can effectively implement the Valet Key pattern to enhance security, performance, and cost efficiency in your cloud applications.\\n\\n* If static content is not included in the application deployment package or process, it may need to be provisioned and deployed independently from the application.\\n* Security access needs to be considered \u2013 i.e., Public write access to prevent unauthorized uploads.\\n* Storage services might not support the use of a custom domain name\\n* File compression, such as gzip, to reduce load times for clients.\\n* Consider how to handle local development and testing\\n* Geographic concerns: Consider using a content delivery network (CDN) to cache the storage container\'s contents in multiple data centers around the world.\\n* Caching of existing assets.\\n\\n#### When to use this pattern\\n\\nStatic Content Hosting is a common pattern used in web applications to offload the delivery of static content from the application server to a cloud-based storage service. This pattern is particularly useful when the application server is not optimized for serving static content or when the application server is under heavy load and needs to offload some of the work to improve performance and scalability.\\n\\n* Reduce the hosting costs for websites and applications that contain some static resources. Cloud-hosted storage is typically much less expensive than compute instances\\n* Improve the performance of your main WebApp by offloading  static content serving\\n* Expose static resources and content for applications running in other hosting environments or on-premises servers. \\n* Improve your application\'s performance and availability by using a content delivery network (CDN) to cache the contents of the storage container in multiple datacenters worldwide. \\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e NeedToOffload{Need to offload delivery of static content from application server?}\\n  NeedToOffload -- Yes --\x3e ServerNotOptimized{Is the application server not optimized for serving static content?}\\n  NeedToOffload -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use this pattern]\\n  ServerNotOptimized -- Yes --\x3e HeavyLoad{Is the application server under heavy load?}\\n  ServerNotOptimized -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  HeavyLoad -- Yes --\x3e ReduceHostingCosts{Need to reduce hosting costs?}\\n  HeavyLoad -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  ReduceHostingCosts -- Yes --\x3e ImprovePerformance{Need to improve performance by offloading static content serving?}\\n  ReduceHostingCosts -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  ImprovePerformance -- Yes --\x3e ExposeResources{Need to expose static resources for applications in other environments?}\\n  ImprovePerformance -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  ExposeResources -- Yes --\x3e UseCDN{Need to improve performance and availability using a CDN?}\\n  ExposeResources -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  UseCDN -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Static Content Hosting pattern]\\n  UseCDN -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n```\\n\\n#### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cdn/cdn-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), and [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n### Design & Implementation Patterns\\n\\n![Design & Implementation Patterns](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_DesignImplementation.PNG)\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf89 Ambassador\\n\\n> Create helper services that send network requests on behalf of a consumer service or application.\\n\\nResilient cloud-based applications require features such as\xa0circuit breaking, routing, metering and monitoring, and the ability to make network-related configuration updates. It may be difficult or impossible to update legacy applications or existing code libraries to add these features because the code is no longer maintained or can\'t be easily modified by the development team.\\nNetwork calls may also require substantial configuration for connection, authentication, and authorization. If these calls are used across multiple applications, built using multiple languages and frameworks, the calls must be configured for each of these instances. In addition, network and security functionality may need to be managed by a central team within your organization. With a large code base, it can be risky for that team to update application code they aren\'t familiar with.\\n\\nPut client frameworks and libraries into an external process that acts as a proxy between your application and external services. Deploy the proxy on the same host environment as your application to allow control over routing, resiliency, and security features and to avoid any host-related access restrictions. \\n\\n![Cloud Design Patterns - Ambassador](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_Ambassador.gif)\\n\\n#### Issues & considerations\\n\\nWhen implementing the Ambassador pattern, consider the following issues and considerations:\\n\\n* Latency Overhead- The proxy adds some latency overhead. It is important to evaluate whether a client library, invoked directly by the application, might be a better approach to avoid this additional latency\\n* Generalized Features - Including generalized features in the proxy can have unintended consequences. For example, the ambassador could handle retries, but this might not be safe unless all operations are idempotent. Ensure that the features implemented in the proxy do not introduce risks or conflicts with the application\'s requirements\\n* Context Passing \u2014 Consider a mechanism that allows the client to pass some context to the proxy and back to the client. For example, include HTTP request headers to opt out of retry or specify the maximum number of times to retry. This flexibility can help tailor the proxy\'s behavior to specific needs.\\n* Packaging and Deployment - Think about how to package and deploy the proxy. The proxy can be deployed as a sidecar to accompany the lifecycle of a consuming application or service. Alternatively, if an ambassador is shared by multiple separate processes on a common host, it can be deployed as a daemon or Windows service\\n* Shared vs. Dedicated Instances - Decide whether to use a single shared instance for all clients or an instance for each client. This decision can impact resource utilization, performance, and isolation between different clients\\n* Security and Configuration - Network calls may require substantial connection, authentication, and authorization configuration. If these calls are used across multiple applications built using multiple languages and frameworks, the calls must be configured for each of these instances. Additionally, network and security functionality may need to be managed by a central team within your organization\\n* Specialized Teams - Features that are offloaded to the ambassador can be managed independently of the application. This allows for separate, specialized teams to implement and maintain security, networking, or authentication features that have been moved to the ambassador without disturbing the application\'s legacy functionalityBy addressing these issues and considerations, you can effectively implement the Ambassador pattern to enhance the networking capabilities, security, and maintainability of your applications.\\n\\n#### When to use this \\n\\nThe Ambassador pattern should be used in the following scenarios:\\n* Offloading Common Client Connectivity Tasks - When you need to offload common client connectivity tasks such as monitoring, logging, routing, security (such as TLS), and resiliency patterns in a language-agnostic way\\n* Legacy Applications - When dealing with legacy applications or other applications that are difficult to modify, the Ambassador pattern can extend their networking capabilities without requiring changes to the application code\\n* Specialized Teams - When you want to enable a specialized team to implement and maintain security, networking, or authentication features independently of the application. This allows for updates and modifications to the ambassador without disturbing the application\'s legacy functionality\\n* Resilient Cloud-Based Applications - When building resilient cloud-based applications that require features such as circuit breaking, routing, metering and monitoring, and the ability to make network-related configuration updates. The Ambassador pattern can facilitate these features without modifying the existing codebase\\n* Centralized Management of Network and Security - When network calls require substantial configuration for connection, authentication, and authorization across multiple applications built using multiple languages and frameworks. The Ambassador pattern allows these configurations to be managed centrally, reducing the risk of updating application code by a team unfamiliar with it\\n* Standardizing and Extending Instrumentation - When you need to standardize and extend instrumentation, such as monitoring performance metrics like latency or resource usage. The Ambassador pattern allows this monitoring to happen in the same host environment as the application\\n* Supporting Cloud or Cluster Connectivity Requirements - When you need to support cloud or cluster connectivity requirements in a legacy application or an application that is difficult to modify considering these scenarios, you can effectively use the Ambassador pattern to enhance the networking capabilities, security, and maintainability of your applications.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e OffloadConnectivityTasks{Offload common client connectivity tasks?}\\n  OffloadConnectivityTasks -- Yes --\x3e LegacyApplications{Dealing with legacy applications?}\\n  OffloadConnectivityTasks -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use this pattern]\\n  LegacyApplications -- Yes --\x3e SpecializedTeams{Enable specialized team to implement and maintain features?}\\n  LegacyApplications -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  SpecializedTeams -- Yes --\x3e ResilientCloudApps{Building resilient cloud-based applications?}\\n  SpecializedTeams -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  ResilientCloudApps -- Yes --\x3e CentralizedManagement{Require centralized management of network and security?}\\n  ResilientCloudApps -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  CentralizedManagement -- Yes --\x3e StandardizeInstrumentation{Need to standardize and extend instrumentation?}\\n  CentralizedManagement -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  StandardizeInstrumentation -- Yes --\x3e CloudClusterConnectivity{Support cloud or cluster connectivity requirements?}\\n  StandardizeInstrumentation -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n  CloudClusterConnectivity -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Ambassador pattern]\\n  CloudClusterConnectivity -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern\\n```\\n\\n#### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and [Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n### \ud83d\ude80 Sidecar\\n\\n> Deploy components of an application into a separate process or container to provide isolation and encapsulation.\\n\\nDeploy application components into a separate process or container to provide isolation and encapsulation. This pattern can also enable applications composed of heterogeneous components and technologies.\\nThis pattern is named\xa0Sidecar\xa0because it resembles a sidecar attached to a motorcycle. In the pattern, the sidecar is attached to a parent application and provides supporting features for the application. The sidecar also shares the same lifecycle as the parent application, being created and retired alongside the parent. The sidecar pattern is sometimes referred to as the sidekick pattern and is a decomposition pattern.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Pattern - Sidecar](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_Sidecar.gif)\\n\\n#### Issues & considerations\\n\\nWhen implementing the Sidecar pattern, consider the following issues and considerations.\\n\\n* Deployment and Packaging - Carefully decide on the deployment and packaging format for services, processes, or containers. Containers are particularly well-suited to the sidecar pattern\\n* Interprocess Communication - Choose the interprocess communication mechanism wisely. Aim to use language- or framework-agnostic technologies unless performance requirements make that impractical\\n* Functionality Placement - Before placing functionality into a sidecar, consider whether it would work better as a separate service or a more traditional daemon. Also, evaluate if the functionality could be implemented as a library or using a traditional extension mechanism, as language-specific libraries may offer deeper integration and less network overhead\\n* Resource Management - The sidecar can access the same resources as the primary application, which allows it to monitor system resources used by both the sidecar and the primary application\\n* Latency - Communication between a parent application and sidecar services includes some overhead, notably call latency. This may not be an acceptable trade-off for chatty interfaces\\n* Application Size and Resource Cost - For small applications, the resource cost of deploying a sidecar service for each instance may not be worth the advantage of isolation\\n* Scaling - If the service needs to scale differently or independently from the main applications, it may be better to deploy the feature as a separate service\\n* Security - By encapsulating tasks and deploying them out-of-process, you can reduce the surface area of sensitive processes to only the code needed to accomplish the task. Sidecars can also add cross-cutting security controls to an application component that is not natively designed with that functionality\\n* Operational Excellence - The sidecar pattern provides an approach to implementing flexibility in tool integration that might enhance the application\'s observability without requiring the application to take direct implementation dependencies. It enables the sidecar functionality to evolve and be maintained independently of the application\'s lifecycle\\n* Performance Efficiency - Moving cross-cutting tasks to a single process that can scale across multiple instances of the main process reduces the need to deploy duplicate functionality for each instance of the application, by addressing these issues and considerations, you can effectively implement the Sidecar pattern to enhance the modularity, security, and maintainability of your applications.\\n\\n#### When to use this \\n\\nThe Sidecar pattern should be used in the following scenarios.\\n\\n* Heterogeneous Set of Languages and Frameworks - When your primary application uses a heterogeneous set of languages and frameworks. A component located in a sidecar service can be consumed by applications written in different languages using different frameworks\\n* Component Ownership by Remote Teams - When a component is owned by a remote team or a different organization. This allows the component to be developed and maintained independently of the main application\\n* Co-location Requirement - When a component or feature must be co-located on the same host as the application. This ensures that the component can access the same resources and environment as the primary application\\n* Independent Updates - When you need a service that shares the overall lifecycle of your main application but can be independently updated. This allows for flexibility in updating the sidecar without affecting the main application\\n* Fine-grained resource Control - When you need fine-grained control over resource limits for a particular resource or component. For example, you may want to restrict the amount of memory a specific component uses. Deploying the component as a sidecar allows you to manage memory usage independently of the main application\\n* Security Enhancements - When you need to encapsulate tasks and deploy them out-of-process to reduce the surface area of sensitive processes to only the code needed to accomplish the task. Sidecars can also add cross-cutting security controls to an application component that is not natively designed with that functionality\\n* Operational Excellence - When you want to implement flexibility in tool integration that might enhance the application\'s observability without requiring the application to take direct implementation dependencies. The sidecar functionality can evolve and be maintained independently of the application\'s lifecycle\\n* Performance Efficiency \u2014 When you want to move cross-cutting tasks to a single process that can scale across multiple instances of the main process, reducing the need to deploy duplicate functionality for each application instance. By considering these scenarios, you can effectively use the Sidecar pattern to enhance the modularity, security, and maintainability of your applications.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e HeterogeneousLanguages{Heterogeneous set of languages and frameworks?}\\n  HeterogeneousLanguages -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Sidecar pattern]\\n  HeterogeneousLanguages -- No --\x3e RemoteTeams{Component ownership by remote teams?}\\n  RemoteTeams -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  RemoteTeams -- No --\x3e CoLocation{Co-location requirement?}\\n  CoLocation -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  CoLocation -- No --\x3e IndependentUpdates{Independent updates?}\\n  IndependentUpdates -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  IndependentUpdates -- No --\x3e FineGrainedControl{Fine-grained resource control?}\\n  FineGrainedControl -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  FineGrainedControl -- No --\x3e SecurityEnhancements{Security enhancements?}\\n  SecurityEnhancements -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  SecurityEnhancements -- No --\x3e OperationalExcellence{Operational excellence?}\\n  OperationalExcellence -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  OperationalExcellence -- No --\x3e PerformanceEfficiency{Performance efficiency?}\\n  PerformanceEfficiency -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  PerformanceEfficiency -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use Sidecar pattern]\\n```\\n\\n#### Azure Solutions\\n\\nUse a\xa0sidecar\xa0container that enhances the application with the required SSL functionality without modifying the application code. The sidecar pattern is a powerful concept in container-based architectures that lets you decompose application functionality into different container images that run together in the same container group.\\nIn an Azure Container Instances container group, each container can take over part of the functionality the application requires. Sidecar containers can use different container images from the application container, even from different image repositories. Containers in the same container group share some properties, such as the underlying network stack.\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Container Instances](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-instances/container-instances-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), and [Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf96\ufe0f Leader Election\\n\\n> Coordinate the actions performed by a collection of collaborating task instances in a distributed application by electing one instance as the leader who assumes responsibility for managing the other instances.\\n\\nA typical cloud application has many tasks acting in a coordinated manner. These tasks could all be instances running the same code and requiring access to the same resources, or they might be working together in parallel to perform the individual parts of a complex calculation.\\nThe task instances might run separately for much of the time, but it might also be necessary to coordinate the actions of each instance to ensure that they don\'t conflict, cause contention for shared resources, or accidentally interfere with the work that other task instances are performing.\\nFor example:\\nIn a cloud-based system that implements horizontal scaling, multiple instances of the same task could be running at the same time with each instance serving a different user. If these instances write to a shared resource, it\'s necessary to coordinate their actions to prevent each instance from overwriting the changes made by the others.\\nIf the tasks are performing individual elements of a complex calculation in parallel, the results need to be aggregated when they are all complete.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Patterns - Leader Election](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_LeaderElection.gif)\\n\\n#### Issues & considerations\\n\\nWhen implementing the Leader Election pattern, consider the following issues and considerations.\\n\\n* Preventing Multiple Leaders - Ensure the election process is managed carefully to prevent two or more instances from taking over the leader position simultaneously. This requires a robust mechanism for selecting a leader that can handle events such as network outages or process failures\\n* Failure Detection - The system must be able to detect when the leader has failed or become unavailable (e.g., due to a communications failure). The speed of detection depends on the system\'s requirements. Some systems can tolerate a short period without a leader, while others need immediate detection and a new election\\n* Handling Leader Termination - In systems with horizontal autoscaling, the leader could be terminated if the system scales back and shuts down some computing resources. Ensure the system can handle such scenarios and elect a new leader promptly\\n* Avoiding Single Points of Failure - Using a shared, distributed mutex introduces a dependency on the external service that provides the mutex, which can become a single point of failure. If this service becomes unavailable, the system won\'t be able to elect a leader\\n* Leader as a Bottleneck - Avoid making the leader a bottleneck in the system. The leader\'s role is to coordinate the work of subordinate tasks, not necessarily to participate in the work itself. Ensure the leader can delegate tasks effectively to avoid performance issues\\n* Latency and Performance - The resulting latency from leader coordination can affect the performance and response times of other processes if they are waiting for the leader to coordinate an operation. Optimize the leader election process to minimize latency\\n* Flexibility and Optimization - Implementing leader election algorithms manually provides the greatest flexibility for tuning and optimizing the code. However, this approach requires careful design and testing to ensure robustness\\n* Election Algorithms - Consider using established leader election algorithms such as the Bully Algorithm or the Ring Algorithm. These algorithms assume each candidate in the election has a unique ID and can communicate reliably with other candidates\\n* Coordination Requirements - Use the Leader Election pattern when tasks in a distributed application need careful coordination and there is no natural leader. This pattern is useful for cloud-hosted solutions where multiple instances need to work together without conflict\\n* Alternative Solutions \u2014 Evaluate whether a more lightweight method, such as optimistic or pessimistic locking, can achieve the required coordination. Also, consider third-party solutions like Apache Zookeeper for managing leader election and coordination tasks. By addressing these issues and considerations, you can effectively implement the Leader Election pattern to ensure reliable and efficient coordination in distributed systems.\\n\\n#### When to use this \\n\\nThe Leader Election pattern should be used in the following scenarios.\\n\\n* Task Coordination - When you need to coordinate a task among multiple instances of a service or application. The Leader Election pattern ensures that one instance acts as the coordinator, preventing conflicts and ensuring smooth operation\\n* Avoiding Single Points of Failure - When you want to avoid having a single point of failure in your application. By using leader election, if the current leader fails, a new leader is automatically selected, ensuring continuous operation without manual intervention\xa0\\n* Distributed Systems - In distributed systems where multiple instances need to work together without conflict. The Leader Election pattern helps in managing coordination tasks effectively across different instances\\n* High Availability Requirements - When your application requires high availability and resilience. The pattern helps in maintaining service continuity by electing a new leader if the current one fails, thus supporting failover mechanisms\\n* Scalability - When you need to scale out your application horizontally. The Leader Election pattern can help manage the coordination of tasks across multiple instances, ensuring that the system scales efficiently without bottlenecks\\n* Consensus Algorithms - When implementing consensus algorithms to manage failover and ensure that work is reliably redirected in case of node malfunctions. This is particularly useful in scenarios where reliability and self-healing are critical\\n* Using Off-the-Shelf Solutions - When you prefer not to implement a leader election algorithm from scratch. Off-the-shelf solutions like Apache Zookeeper can be used to manage leader election and coordination tasks effectively. By considering these scenarios, you can effectively use the Leader Election pattern to ensure reliable and efficient coordination in distributed systems, enhancing the overall resilience and scalability of your application.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e TaskCoordination{Task coordination among multiple instances?}\\n  TaskCoordination -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Leader Election pattern]\\n  TaskCoordination -- No --\x3e AvoidSinglePointFailure{Avoid single point of failure?}\\n  AvoidSinglePointFailure -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  AvoidSinglePointFailure -- No --\x3e DistributedSystems{Working with distributed systems?}\\n  DistributedSystems -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  DistributedSystems -- No --\x3e HighAvailability{High availability requirements?}\\n  HighAvailability -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  HighAvailability -- No --\x3e Scalability{Need to scale out application horizontally?}\\n  Scalability -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  Scalability -- No --\x3e ConsensusAlgorithms{Implementing consensus algorithms?}\\n  ConsensusAlgorithms -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  ConsensusAlgorithms -- No --\x3e OffTheShelfSolutions{Prefer using off-the-shelf solutions?}\\n  OffTheShelfSolutions -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  OffTheShelfSolutions -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use Leader Election pattern]\\n```\\n\\n#### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Service Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), and [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf33 Strangler Fig\\n\\n> Incrementally migrate a legacy system by gradually replacing specific pieces of functionality with new applications and services.\\n\\nAs systems age, the development tools, hosting technology, and even system architectures they were built on can become increasingly obsolete. As new features and functionality are added, the complexity of these applications can increase dramatically, making them harder to maintain or add new features to.\\nCompletely replacing a complex system can be a huge undertaking. Often, you will need a gradual migration to a new system, while keeping the old system to handle features that haven\'t been migrated yet. However, running two separate versions of an application means that clients have to know where particular features are located. Every time a feature or service is migrated, clients need to be updated to point to the new location.\\n\\nThe Strangler Fig pattern involves gradually replacing parts of the legacy system with new services. This allows for a controlled and step-by-step transition rather than a wholesale move.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Patterns - Strangler Fig](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_StranglerFig.gif)\\n\\n#### Issues & considerations\\n\\nWhen implementing the Strangler Fig pattern, consider the following issues and considerations.\\n\\n* Handling Services and Data Stores - Ensure that both new and legacy systems can access shared services and data stores. This is crucial for maintaining consistency and avoiding data integrity issues during the migration process\xa0\\n* Structuring New Applications - Structure new applications and services in a way that they can easily be intercepted and replaced in future migrations. This helps in maintaining flexibility and ease of further transitions.\\n* Facade Management - The facade, which intercepts requests and routes them to either the legacy or new system, must keep up with the migration. It should not become a single point of failure or a performance bottleneck. Proper management and monitoring of the facade are essential to ensure smooth operation2\xa0\\n* Incremental Migration - The pattern supports incremental migration, which helps to minimize risk and spread the development effort over time. However, this requires careful planning to ensure that each increment is functional and does not disrupt the overall system\\n* Client Updates - Running two separate versions of an application means that clients need to be updated to know where particular features are located. This can add complexity to the migration process, as each client must be aware of the changes and adapt accordingly\\n* Avoiding Single Points of Failure - Ensure that the facade does not become a single point of failure. It should be designed to handle high availability and failover scenarios to maintain system reliability during the migration\\n* Performance Considerations - The facade should not become a performance bottleneck. It must be capable of handling the load and routing requests efficiently to avoid degrading the user experience\\n* Completing the Migration - At some point, when the migration is complete, the strangler fig facade will either go away or evolve into an adaptor for legacy clients. Plan for this transition to ensure that the final system is clean and does not retain unnecessary components2\xa0By addressing these issues and considerations, you can effectively implement the Strangler Fig pattern to ensure a smooth and controlled migration from a legacy system to a new architecture.\\n\\n#### When to use this \\n\\nThe Strangler Fig pattern should be used in the following scenarios.\\n\\n* Gradual Migration -  When you need to incrementally migrate a legacy system to a new architecture. This pattern allows you to gradually replace specific pieces of functionality with new applications and services, minimizing risk and spreading the development effort over time\\n* Complex Systems - When dealing with complex systems where a complete replacement would be a huge undertaking. The Strangler Fig pattern enables a controlled decomposition of a monolith into a set of microservices, allowing the legacy system to continue functioning while new features are added to the new system\\n* Maintaining Functionality - When it is essential to keep the legacy system operational during the migration. The facade in the Strangler Fig pattern intercepts requests and routes them to either the legacy application or the new services, ensuring that consumers can continue using the same interface without being aware of the migration\\n* Avoiding Big Bang Rewrites - When you want to avoid the risks associated with a \\"big bang\\" rewrite. The Strangler Fig pattern supports an incremental approach, allowing you to add functionality to the new system at your own pace while ensuring the legacy application continues to function\\n* Modernizing Legacy Systems - When modernizing legacy systems that have become increasingly obsolete due to outdated development tools, hosting technology, or system architectures. The pattern helps in gradually transitioning to a new system while maintaining the old system for features that haven\'t been migrated yet\\n* Using Modern Orchestration Tools - When you want to leverage modern orchestration tools such as Azure DevOps to manage the lifecycle of each service. Once the application has been decomposed into constituent microservices, these tools can be used to manage the new system effectively. Considering these scenarios, you can effectively use the Strangler Fig pattern to ensure a smooth and controlled migration from a legacy system to a new architecture, enhancing the overall resilience and scalability of your application.\\n\\n#### Azure Solutions\\n\\nMany [Azure products](https://azure.microsoft.com/products?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), can be used to implement this pattern.\\n\\n### Messaging Patterns\\n\\n![Messaging Patterns](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_Messaging.PNG)\\n\\n#### \ud83d\ude9a Sequential Convoy\\n\\n> Process a set of related messages in a defined order without blocking the processing of other groups of messages.\\n\\nApplications often need to process a sequence of messages in the order they arrive, while still being able to scale out to handle increased load. In a distributed architecture, processing these messages in order is not straightforward, because the workers can scale independently and often pull messages independently\\n\\nPush related messages into categories within the queuing system, and have the queue listeners lock and pull only from one category, one message at a time.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Pattern - Sequential Covey](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_SequentialCovey.gif)\\n\\n##### Issues & considerations\\n\\nThe Sequential Convoy pattern is designed to process a set of related messages in a defined order without blocking the processing of other groups of messages. Here are some issues and considerations associated with this pattern\\n\\n* Message Ordering - Ensuring that messages are processed in the order they arrive can be challenging in a distributed architecture. Workers can scale independently and often pull messages independently, which can disrupt the order of processing\\n* Scalability - While the pattern allows for scaling out to handle increased load, it requires careful management to ensure that the order of messages is maintained. This can involve categorizing related messages within the queuing system and having queue listeners lock and pull only from one category at a time\\n* Complexity in Implementation - Implementing the Sequential Convoy pattern can be complex, especially when dealing with interleaved transactions for multiple orders. The system must be designed to handle these transactions in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner at the order level\\n* Resource Management - Efficiently managing resources to ensure that the processing of one group of messages does not block others is crucial. This involves coordinating actions across distributed services and remote resources\\n* Error Handling - Handling errors in a sequential processing system can be more complex. If an error occurs, the system must ensure that subsequent messages are not processed until the error is resolved, which can involve implementing compensating transactions or other error recovery mechanisms By addressing these issues and considerations, the Sequential Convoy pattern can be effectively implemented to ensure ordered processing of related messages in a distributed system.\\n\\n##### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe Sequential Convoy pattern should be used in the following scenarios.\\n\\n* Ordered Message Processing - When you have messages that arrive in a specific order and must be processed in that same order. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of the operations being performed\\n* Categorized Messages - When arriving messages can be categorized in such a way that the category becomes a unit of scale for the system. For example, in an order tracking system, messages can be categorized by order ID, ensuring that all operations related to a specific order are processed sequentially\\n* Avoiding Blocking - When you need to process a set of related messages in a defined order without blocking the processing of other groups of messages. This allows for efficient handling of multiple message groups concurrently while maintaining order within each group\xa0However, this pattern might not be suitable for extremely high throughput scenarios (millions of messages per minute or second), as the FIFO (First in and First Out) requirement limits the scaling that can be done by the system.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e OrderedMessageProcessing{Ordered message processing?}\\n  OrderedMessageProcessing -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Sequential Convoy pattern]\\n  OrderedMessageProcessing -- No --\x3e CategorizedMessages{Categorized messages?}\\n  CategorizedMessages -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  CategorizedMessages -- No --\x3e AvoidBlocking{Avoid blocking while processing related messages?}\\n  AvoidBlocking -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  AvoidBlocking -- No --\x3e HighThroughput{Extremely high throughput scenarios?}\\n  HighThroughput -- Yes --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use Sequential Convoy pattern]\\n  HighThroughput -- No --\x3e UsePattern\\n```\\n\\n##### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Event Grid](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), and [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n### \ud83d\udccc Queue-Based Load Leveling\\n\\n> Use a buffer between a task and a service that it invokes in order to smooth intermittent heavy loads.\\n\\nUse a queue that acts as a buffer between a task and a service it invokes to smooth intermittent heavy loads that can cause the service to fail or the task to time out. This can help minimize the impact of peaks in demand on availability and responsiveness for both the task and the service.\\nContext and problem, many solutions in the cloud involve running tasks that invoke services. In this environment, if a service is subjected to intermittent heavy loads, it can cause performance or reliability issues.\\nA service could be part of the same solution as the tasks that use it, or it could be a third-party service providing access to frequently used resources such as a cache or a storage service. If the same service is used by a number of tasks running concurrently, it can be difficult to predict the volume of requests to the service at any time.\\nA service might experience peaks in demand that cause it to overload and be unable to respond to requests in a timely manner. Flooding a service with a large number of concurrent requests can also result in the service failing if it\'s unable to handle the contention these requests cause.\\nSolution, Refactor the solution and introduce a queue between the task and the service.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Patterns - Queue Based Levelling ](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_QueueBasedLeveling.gif)\\n\\n##### Issues & considerations\\n\\nThe Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern is designed to handle intermittent heavy loads by using a queue as a buffer between a task and a service it invokes. Here are some issues and considerations associated with this pattern\\n\\n* Rate Control - It is necessary to implement application logic that controls the rate at which services handle messages to avoid overwhelming the target resource. This involves ensuring that spikes in demand are not passed to the next stage of the system\\n* Testing Under Load - The system should be tested under load to ensure that it provides the required leveling. Adjustments may be needed in the number of queues and the number of service instances that handle messages to achieve optimal performance\\n* Scalability - The pattern can help maximize scalability because both the number of queues and the number of services can be varied to meet demand. However, careful management is required to ensure that the system scales effectively without introducing bottlenecks\\n* Availability - This pattern can help maximize availability because delays in services won\'t have an immediate and direct impact on the application. The application can continue to post messages to the queue even when the service isn\'t available or isn\'t currently processing messages\\n* Cost Control - The number of service instances deployed only needs to be adequate to meet the average load rather than the peak load, which can help control costs. However, this requires careful monitoring and adjustment to ensure that the system remains cost-effective while meeting performance requirements\\n* Throttling - Some services implement throttling when demand reaches a threshold beyond which the system could fail. Implementing load-leveling with these services can ensure that this threshold isn\'t reached, thereby maintaining service functionality\\n* Temporal Decoupling - A message broker provides temporal decoupling, meaning the producer and consumer do not have to run concurrently. This allows the producer to send messages regardless of the consumer\'s availability, and the consumer can process messages at its own pace\\n* Asynchronous Processing \u2014 The pattern supports asynchronous message processing, which can help maintain the responsiveness of the user interface and distribute processing across multiple servers to improve throughput. By considering these issues and implementing appropriate strategies, the Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern can effectively manage load and improve a system\'s resilience and scalability.\\n\\n##### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern should be used in the following scenarios:\\n\\n* Handling Intermittent Heavy Loads - When a service is subjected to intermittent heavy loads that can cause performance or reliability issues, this pattern helps to smooth out these loads by using a queue as a buffer between the task and the service it invokes\\n* Decoupling Tasks from Services - When you need to decouple tasks from services to allow the service to handle messages at its own pace, regardless of the volume of requests from concurrent tasks. This ensures that the service is not overwhelmed by a sudden spike in demand\\n* Maximizing Availability - When you want to ensure that delays in services do not have an immediate and direct impact on the application. The application can continue to post messages to the queue even when the service isn\'t available or isn\'t currently processing messages\\n* Maximizing Scalability - When you need to scale both the number of queues and the number of services to meet demand. This pattern allows for flexible scaling to handle varying loads\\n* Cost Control - When you want to control costs by deploying a number of service instances that only need to be adequate to meet the average load rather than the peak load. This can help in reducing the overall cost of the system\\n* Throttling - When services implement throttling to prevent system failure due to high demand. The Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern can help ensure that the demand does not exceed the service\'s capacity, thereby maintaining functionality\\n* Asynchronous Processing \u2014 When you need to perform tasks asynchronously to maintain the responsiveness of the user interface and distribute processing across multiple servers to improve throughput, you can use the Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern in these scenarios to improve your system\'s resilience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e IntermittentHeavyLoads{Handling Intermittent Heavy Loads?}\\n  IntermittentHeavyLoads -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern]\\n  IntermittentHeavyLoads -- No --\x3e DecouplingTasks{Decoupling Tasks from Services?}\\n  DecouplingTasks -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  DecouplingTasks -- No --\x3e MaximizingAvailability{Maximizing Availability?}\\n  MaximizingAvailability -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  MaximizingAvailability -- No --\x3e MaximizingScalability{Maximizing Scalability?}\\n  MaximizingScalability -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  MaximizingScalability -- No --\x3e CostControl{Cost Control?}\\n  CostControl -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  CostControl -- No --\x3e Throttling{Services implement Throttling?}\\n  Throttling -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  Throttling -- No --\x3e AsynchronousProcessing{Asynchronous Processing?}\\n  AsynchronousProcessing -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  AsynchronousProcessing -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern]\\n```\\n\\n##### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Event Grid](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), and [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udccc Publisher-Subscriber\\n\\n> Enable an application to announce events to multiple interested consumers asynchronously, without coupling the senders to the receivers.\\n\\nPublisher-Subscriber, or PubSub for short, enables an application to announce events to multiple interested consumers asynchronously without coupling the senders to the receivers.\\n\\nIn cloud-based and distributed applications, system components often need to provide information to other components as events occur.\\nAsynchronous messaging is an effective way to decouple senders from consumers and avoid blocking the sender from waiting for a response. The sender uses an input messaging channel. The sender packages events into messages, using a known message format, and sends these messages via the input channel. The sender in this pattern is also called the\xa0publisher.\\n\\nOne output messaging channel per consumer. The consumers are known as\xa0subscribers.\\nA mechanism for copying each message from the input channel to the output channels for all subscribers interested in that message. This operation is typically handled by an intermediary such as a message broker or event bus.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Pattern - Publisher-Subscriber (PubSub)](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_PubSub.gif)\\n\\n##### Issues & considerations\\n\\nThe Publisher-Subscriber pattern, also known as Pub-Sub, is a messaging pattern where an application (publisher) sends messages or events to multiple interested consumers (subscribers) asynchronously. Here are some issues and considerations associated with this pattern\\n\\n* Scalability - One of the main challenges is ensuring the system can scale efficiently as the number of subscribers increases. Each new subscriber typically requires additional resources and potentially changes to the application code to handle the new message queue\\n* Message Delivery - Ensuring that messages are delivered to all subscribers reliably and in a timely manner can be complex. Message queues generally aim to deliver messages in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner, but this order is not always guaranteed, especially under high-load conditions\\n* Monitoring and Alerts - Implementing effective monitoring and alerting mechanisms is crucial to tracking the performance of message queues, detecting stuck messages, and ensuring that subscribers are processing messages efficiently\\n* Security - Ensuring that messages are encrypted and only authorized subscribers can access them is essential. This involves implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms\\n* Handling Subscriptions - Deciding how to manage subscriptions is important. You need to determine whether subscribers can subscribe and unsubscribe at their own pace or if an approval mechanism is required\\n* Message Duplication - Handling duplicate messages is necessary because message queues guarantee at least one delivery, which means there is a chance that a message might be delivered more than once. Implementing deduplication mechanisms can help manage this issue\\n* Poison Messages - Managing poison messages, which are messages that repeatedly fail to be processed, is important. These messages should be moved to a separate poison queue to free up the main queue for other messages\\n* One-Way Communication - The Pub-Sub pattern is inherently one-way, meaning that subscribers cannot send acknowledgments or responses back to the publisher. If two-way communication is needed, another pattern like Request-Reply should be implemented\\n* Message Expiration - Defining how long messages should remain in the queue before they expire is important. This helps in managing the lifecycle of messages and ensuring that outdated messages do not clog the system \\n* Wildcard Subscriptions \u2014 Implementing wildcard subscriptions can allow subscribers to subscribe to all topics with a single action, simplifying the management of multiple topics. By addressing these issues and considerations, the Publisher-Subscriber pattern can be effectively implemented to enable scalable, reliable, and secure asynchronous communication between publishers and multiple subscribers.\\n\\n##### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe Publisher-Subscriber (Pub-Sub) pattern should be used in the following scenarios.\\n\\n* Broadcasting Information to Multiple Consumers - When you need to send the same information to multiple consumers simultaneously, the Pub-Sub pattern is ideal. This allows a single publisher to broadcast messages to multiple subscribers without needing to send individual messages to each one\\n* Decoupling Senders and Receivers - When you want to decouple the senders of messages from the receivers, enabling them to operate independently. This is useful in systems where the publisher does not need to know about the subscribers and vice versa\\n* Asynchronous Communication - When you need to enable asynchronous communication between different parts of a system. This allows the publisher to send messages without waiting for the subscribers to process them, improving the overall responsiveness and scalability of the system \\n* Event-Driven Architectures - When implementing event-driven architectures where components need to react to events as they happen. The Pub-Sub pattern allows for real-time event propagation to multiple interested parties\\n* Handling Real-Time Notifications - When you need to provide real-time notifications to multiple subscribers, such as in monitoring systems, alerting mechanisms or live data feeds \\n* Scalability and Flexibility - When you need a scalable and flexible system where new subscribers can be added without modifying the publisher. This allows the system to grow and adapt to new requirements easily\\n* Filtering and Routing Messages \u2014 When you need to filter and route messages to specific subscribers based on certain criteria, you can use topics and content filtering mechanisms. By using the Publisher-Subscriber pattern in these scenarios, you can create a robust, scalable, and flexible messaging system that efficiently handles communication between different components.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e BroadcastingInfo{Broadcasting Information to Multiple Consumers?}\\n  BroadcastingInfo -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Pub-Sub pattern]\\n  BroadcastingInfo -- No --\x3e DecouplingSendersReceivers{Decoupling Senders and Receivers?}\\n  DecouplingSendersReceivers -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  DecouplingSendersReceivers -- No --\x3e AsynchronousCommunication{Asynchronous Communication?}\\n  AsynchronousCommunication -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  AsynchronousCommunication -- No --\x3e EventDrivenArchitectures{Event-Driven Architectures?}\\n  EventDrivenArchitectures -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  EventDrivenArchitectures -- No --\x3e RealTimeNotifications{Handling Real-Time Notifications?}\\n  RealTimeNotifications -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  RealTimeNotifications -- No --\x3e ScalabilityFlexibility{Scalability and Flexibility?}\\n  ScalabilityFlexibility -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  ScalabilityFlexibility -- No --\x3e FilteringRoutingMessages{Filtering and Routing Messages?}\\n  FilteringRoutingMessages -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  FilteringRoutingMessages -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use Pub-Sub pattern]\\n```\\n\\n##### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Event Grid](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udd04 Asynchronous Request-Reply\\n\\n> Decouple backend processing from a frontend host, where backend processing needs to be asynchronous, but the frontend still needs a clear response.\\n\\nIn modern application development, it\'s normal for client applications \u2014 often code running in a web client (browser) \u2014 to depend on remote APIs to provide business logic and compose functionality. In most cases, APIs for a client network infrastructure are largely out of the control of the application developer. Most APIs can respond quickly enough for responses to arrive back over the same connection. Application code can make a synchronous API call in a non-blocking way, giving the appearance of asynchronous processing, which is recommended for I/O-bound operations.\\nIn some scenarios, however, the work done by the backend may be long-running, on the order of seconds, or might be a background process that is executed in minutes or even hours. In that case, it isn\'t feasible to wait for the work to complete before responding to the request. This situation is a potential problem for any synchronous request-reply pattern. Applications are designed to respond quickly, on the order of 100 ms or less.\xa0\\nOne solution to this problem is to use HTTP polling. Polling is useful to client-side code, as it can be hard to provide call-back endpoints or use long-running connections. Even when callbacks are possible, the extra libraries and services that are required can sometimes add too much extra complexity.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Pattern - Asyncronous Request-Reply](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_AsyncronousRequestReply.gif)\\n\\n##### Issues & considerations\\n\\nThe Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern is used to decouple backend processing from a frontend host, where backend processing needs to be asynchronous, but the frontend still needs a clear response. Here are some issues and considerations associated with this pattern\\n\\n* Latency and Response Time - The pattern is designed to handle scenarios where backend processing is long-running. However, this introduces latency in the response time, as the client has to poll for the result of the long-running operation. This can affect the user experience if not managed properly\\n* Polling Mechanism - Implementing an efficient polling mechanism is crucial. The HTTP02 response should indicate the location and frequency that the client should poll for the response. This helps in managing the load on the server and ensures that the client does not overwhelm the server with frequent polling requests\\n* Handling Long-Running Operations - The backend must be capable of handling long-running operations efficiently. This includes offloading processing to another component, such as a message queue, and ensuring that the status endpoint can accurately reflect the progress of the operation\\n* Error Handling - Proper error handling mechanisms need to be in place. If an error occurs during processing, the error should persist at the resource URL described in the location header, and the appropriate response code (HTTP 4xx) should be returned. This ensures that the client is aware of any issues and can take appropriate action\\n* Status Codes and Redirects - The API should return the correct status codes based on the state of the operation. For example, upon successful processing, the API should return HTTP00 (OK), HTTP01 (Created), or HTTP04 (No Content). If the status endpoint redirects on completion, HTTP 302 or HTTP 303 should be used\\n* Client-Side Considerations - The client-side code must be designed to handle asynchronous responses. This includes managing the polling logic, handling different status codes, and updating the user interface based on the progress and completion of the operation\\n* Scalability - The pattern allows the client process and the backend API to scale independently. However, this separation also brings additional complexity when the client requires success notification, as this step needs to become asynchronous\\n* Security - Ensuring secure communication between the client and the server is essential. This includes validating both the request and the action to be performed before starting the long-running process and ensuring that sensitive data is protected during transmission\\n* Legacy Clients - Some legacy clients might not support this pattern. It is important to consider the compatibility of the pattern with existing clients and whether additional support or alternative solutions are needed for those clients\\n* Resource Management - Efficiently managing resources such as message queues and status endpoints is crucial to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure the system can handle many concurrent requests. By addressing these issues and considerations, the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern can be effectively implemented to handle long-running operations while providing a clear response to the client.\\n\\n##### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern should be used in the following scenarios.\\n\\n* Long-Running Backend Operations - When the backend processing is long-running, taking seconds, minutes, or even hours, and it is not feasible to keep the client waiting for the operation to complete. This pattern allows the client to initiate the request and then poll for the result later\\n* Decoupling Frontend and Backend - When you need to decouple the frontend host from the backend processing. This is useful in scenarios where the frontend needs a clear response, but the backend processing needs to be asynchronous\\n* Scalability - When you want to enable the client process and the backend API to scale independently. By using a message broker to separate the request and response stages, you can achieve better scalability and manage load more effectively\\n* Handling High Latency - When factors such as network infrastructure, geographic location, or current load can add significant latency to the response. The pattern helps mitigate these issues by allowing the backend to process the request asynchronously and the client to poll for the result\\n* Microservices Architectures - When implementing microservices architectures where server-to-server REST API calls are common. The pattern helps manage long-running operations and decouples services, making the system more resilient and scalable\\n* Client-Side Polling - When it is difficult to provide call-back endpoints or use long-running connections on the client side. The pattern allows the client to poll for the result, which can be simpler and more efficient in certain scenariosBy using the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern in these scenarios, you can effectively manage long-running operations, improve scalability, and decouple frontend and backend processing, leading to a more robust and responsive system.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e LongRunningBackendOperations{Long-Running Backend Operations?}\\n  LongRunningBackendOperations -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern]\\n  LongRunningBackendOperations -- No --\x3e DecouplingFrontendBackend{Decoupling Frontend and Backend?}\\n  DecouplingFrontendBackend -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  DecouplingFrontendBackend -- No --\x3e Scalability{Scalability?}\\n  Scalability -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  Scalability -- No --\x3e HandlingHighLatency{Handling High Latency?}\\n  HandlingHighLatency -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  HandlingHighLatency -- No --\x3e MicroservicesArchitectures{Microservices Architectures?}\\n  MicroservicesArchitectures -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  MicroservicesArchitectures -- No --\x3e ClientSidePolling{Client-Side Polling?}\\n  ClientSidePolling -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  ClientSidePolling -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern]\\n```\\n\\n##### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAn application that uses Azure Functions to implement this pattern. There are three functions in the solution:\\n\\n* The asynchronous API endpoint.\\n* The status endpoint.\\n* A backend function that takes queued work items and executes them.\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), and [Azure Storage Queues](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/queues/storage-queues-introduction?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n### Reliability Patterns\\n\\n![Reliability Patterns](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_Reliability.PNG)\\n\\n#### \u26a1\ufe0f Circuit Breaker\\n\\n> Handle faults that might take a variable amount of time to recover from when connecting to a remote service or resource. This can improve an application\'s stability and resiliency.\\n\\nIn a distributed environment, calls to remote resources and services can fail due to transient faults, such as slow network connections, timeouts, or the resources being overcommitted or temporarily unavailable. These faults typically correct themselves after a short period of time, and a robust cloud application should be prepared to handle them by using a strategy such as the\xa0[Retry pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/application-resiliency-patterns?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#retry-pattern).\\nHowever, there can also be situations where faults are due to unanticipated events, and that might take much longer to fix. These faults can range in severity from a partial loss of connectivity to the complete failure of a service. In these situations, it might be pointless for an application to retry an operation that is unlikely to succeed continually, and instead, the application should quickly accept that the operation has failed and handle this failure accordingly. Additionally, if a service is very busy, failure in one part of the system might lead to cascading failures. The purpose of the Circuit Breaker pattern is different than the Retry pattern. The Retry pattern enables an application to retry an operation in the expectation that it\'ll succeed. The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents an application from performing an operation that is likely to fail. An application can combine these two patterns by using the Retry pattern to invoke an operation through a circuit breaker. However, the retry logic should be sensitive to any exceptions returned by the circuit breaker and abandon retry attempts if the circuit breaker indicates that a fault is not transient. The failure counter used by the\xa0Closed\xa0state is time-based. It\'s automatically reset at periodic intervals. This helps to prevent the circuit breaker from entering the\xa0Open\xa0state if it experiences occasional failures.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Patterns - Circuit Breaker](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_CircuitBreaker.gif)\\n\\n##### Issues & considerations\\n\\nThe Circuit Breaker pattern is designed to handle faults that might take a variable amount of time to recover from, especially when connecting to remote services or resources. Here are some issues and considerations associated with this pattern\\n\\n* State Management - The Circuit Breaker pattern typically involves three states: Closed, Open, and Half-Open. Managing these states correctly is crucial. The Closed state allows normal operation, the Open state immediately fails requests, and the Half-Open state allows a limited number of test requests to check if the issue has been resolved\\n* Thresholds and Timeouts - Setting appropriate thresholds for the number of failures and timeouts is essential. If the thresholds are too low, the circuit breaker might open too frequently, causing unnecessary failures. If they are too high, the system might not protect itself effectively from cascading failures\\n* Recovery Testing - In the Open state, the circuit breaker should periodically test the service to see if it has recovered. This can be done using a timer or by pinging the service. The interval for these tests should be carefully chosen based on the criticality of the operation and the nature of the service\xa0\\n* Manual Override - Providing a manual override option can be beneficial in systems where the recovery time for a failing operation is extremely variable. This allows administrators to manually reset the circuit breaker or force it into the Open state as needed\\n* Concurrency - The circuit breaker might be accessed by a large number of concurrent instances of an application. The implementation should ensure that it does not block concurrent requests or add excessive overhead to each call\\n* Resource Differentiation - Using a single circuit breaker for multiple underlying independent providers can be problematic. For example, in a data store with multiple shards, one shard might be accessible while another is experiencing issues. The circuit breaker should differentiate between these resources to avoid unnecessary failures\\n* Accelerated Circuit Breaking - Sometimes, a failure response can provide enough information for the circuit breaker to trip immediately and stay tripped for a minimum amount of time. For example, an overloaded shared resource might indicate that an immediate retry is not recommended\\n* Replaying Failed Requests - In the Open state, the circuit breaker could record the details of each failed request and arrange for these requests to be replayed when the service becomes available again. This ensures that important operations are not lost\\n* Inappropriate Timeouts - The circuit breaker might not fully protect applications from operations that fail in external services configured with lengthy timeouts. If the timeout is too long, a thread running the circuit breaker might be blocked for an extended period, tying up resources\\n* Impact on Shared Resources - Aggressive retry policies can cause an increasing number of transient faults for other users and applications sharing the same resources. It is important to consider the impact of the circuit breaker on shared resources and other tenants in a multi-tenant environment. Addressing these issues and considerations, the Circuit Breaker pattern can be effectively implemented to improve the stability and resiliency of an application, preventing cascading failures and managing long-lasting faults efficiently.\\n\\n##### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe Circuit Breaker pattern should be used in the following scenarios.\\n\\n* Handling Persistent or Non-Transient Errors - When an application encounters persistent or non-transient errors, such as a service being down or a network failure, the Circuit Breaker pattern can prevent the application from continually trying to perform an operation that is likely to fail\\n* Preventing Resource Exhaustion - If a service is frequently unavailable or busy, it might be due to resource exhaustion. The Circuit Breaker pattern helps to prevent further strain on the service by stopping additional requests until the service has had time to recover\\n* Improving System Stability - The pattern provides stability while the system recovers from a failure and minimizes the impact on performance. It quickly rejects requests for operations that are likely to fail rather than waiting for them to time out or never return\\n* Managing Long-Lasting Faults - When faults are likely to be long-lasting or terminal, the Circuit Breaker pattern can handle these faults as exceptions. The application can log the exception and try to continue by invoking an alternative service or offering degraded functionality\\n* Avoiding Cascading Failures - The pattern helps mitigate failures and avoid cascading failures disrupting the entire application. By stopping requests to a failing service, it prevents the failure from propagating to other parts of the system\\n* Testing Service Recovery - The Circuit Breaker pattern allows the application to periodically test the service to detect when it becomes available again. This can be done on an intermittent basis with long intervals between requests, depending on the criticality of the operation and the nature of the service\\n* Logging and Monitoring\u2014The pattern can be used to log all failed requests and monitor the operation\'s health. This information can be used to alert administrators when a circuit breaker trips to the Open state, providing insights into the system\'s health. Using the Circuit Breaker pattern in these scenarios, you can improve the resiliency and stability of your application, prevent resource exhaustion, and manage long-lasting faults effectively.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e PersistentErrors{Handling Persistent or Non-Transient Errors?}\\n  PersistentErrors -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Circuit Breaker pattern]\\n  PersistentErrors -- No --\x3e ResourceExhaustion{Preventing Resource Exhaustion?}\\n  ResourceExhaustion -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  ResourceExhaustion -- No --\x3e SystemStability{Improving System Stability?}\\n  SystemStability -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  SystemStability -- No --\x3e LongLastingFaults{Managing Long-Lasting Faults?}\\n  LongLastingFaults -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  LongLastingFaults -- No --\x3e CascadingFailures{Avoiding Cascading Failures?}\\n  CascadingFailures -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  CascadingFailures -- No --\x3e ServiceRecovery{Testing Service Recovery?}\\n  ServiceRecovery -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  ServiceRecovery -- No --\x3e LoggingMonitoring{Logging and Monitoring?}\\n  LoggingMonitoring -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  LoggingMonitoring -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use Circuit Breaker pattern]\\n```\\n\\n##### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udcee Deployment Stamps\\n\\n> The deployment stamp pattern involves provisioning, managing, and monitoring a heterogeneous group of resources to host and operate multiple workloads or tenants.\\n\\nThe deployment stamp pattern involves provisioning, managing, and monitoring a heterogeneous group of resources to host and operate multiple workloads or tenants. Each individual copy is called a\xa0stamp or sometimes a\xa0service unit,\xa0scale unit, or\xa0cell. In a multitenant environment, every stamp or scale unit can serve a predefined number of tenants. Multiple stamps can be deployed to scale the solution almost linearly and serve an increasing number of tenants. This approach can improve the scalability of your solution, allow you to deploy instances across multiple regions, and separate your customer data. consider grouping resources in\xa0scale units\xa0and provisioning multiple copies of your\xa0stamps. Each\xa0scale unit\xa0will host and serve a subset of your tenants. Stamps operate independently of each other and can be deployed and updated independently. A single geographical region might contain a single stamp or might contain multiple stamps to allow for horizontal scale-out within the region.\xa0\\n\\n![Cloud Design - Deployment Stamps](Blog_CloudDesignPatternsDeploymentStamps.gif)\\n\\n##### Issues & considerations\\n\\nSeveral issues and considerations need to be addressed when implementing the deployment stamp pattern to ensure a successful deployment.\\n\\n* Deployment Process - It\'s crucial to have automated and fully repeatable deployment processes. Tools like Bicep, JSON ARM templates, or Terraform modules can be used to declaratively define your stamps and keep the definitions consistent\\n* Cross-Stamp Operations - When your solution is deployed across multiple stamps, operations that span multiple stamps, such as aggregating customer data, can become complex. Queries might need to be executed against each stamp, and the results aggregated. Alternatively, consider having all stamps publish data into a centralized data warehouse for consolidated reporting\\n* Determining Scale-Out Policies - Stamps have a finite capacity, which might be defined using a proxy metric such as the number of tenants that can be deployed to the stamp. It\'s important to monitor the available and used capacity for each stamp and proactively deploy additional stamps to accommodate new tenants\\n* Minimum Number of Stamps - It\'s advisable to deploy at least two stamps of your solution to avoid hard-coding assumptions in your code or configuration that won\'t apply when you scale out\\n* Cost - Deploying multiple copies of your infrastructure components will likely involve a substantial increase in the cost of operating your solution. This includes the cost of additional memory, compute, and other resources required for each stamp2\xa0\\n* Moving Between Stamps - Each stamp is deployed and operated independently, so moving tenants between stamps can be difficult. Custom logic is needed to transmit customer information to a different stamp and remove it from the original stamp. This process might require a backplane for communication between stamps, further increasing the complexity of the solution\\n* Traffic Routing - Routing traffic to the correct stamp for a given request can require an additional component to resolve tenants to stamps. This component needs to be highly available to ensure reliable traffic routing\\n* Shared Components - Some components might be shared across stamps. For example, a shared single-page app for all tenants could be deployed in one region and replicated globally using Azure CDN\\n* Geographical Distribution - For multi-region applications, each tenant\'s data and traffic should be directed to a specific region. This ensures that requests are routed to the correct stamp based on the user\'s geographical location\\n* Resiliency During Outages - Stamps are independent of one another, so if an outage affects a single stamp, tenants deployed to other stamps should not be affected. This isolation helps to contain the \'blast radius\' of an incident or outage\\n* Handling Single and Multi-Tenant Instances - The pattern should support both single and multi-tenant instances, ensuring that each tenant\'s data is isolated and secure\\n* Update Frequency \u2014 Different stamps might need to be on different versions of your solution at the same time. This requires careful management of updates and version control across stamps. By considering these issues and implementing appropriate strategies, the Deployment Stamp pattern can effectively improve the scalability, resiliency, and manageability of your solution.\\n\\n##### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe Deployment Stamp pattern is useful in the following scenarios\\n\\n* Natural Limits on Scalability - If certain components of your system cannot or should not scale beyond a specific number of customers or requests, the Deployment Stamp pattern allows you to scale out by deploying multiple instances (stamps) of your solution\\n* Tenant Isolation - When there is a requirement to separate certain tenants from others due to security concerns or compliance requirements, the Deployment Stamp pattern can be used to deploy these tenants onto their own isolated stamps\\n* Multi-Region Applications - For applications that need to be deployed across multiple regions, each tenant\'s data and traffic can be directed to a specific region. This ensures that requests are routed to the correct stamp based on the user\'s geographical location\\n* Resiliency During Outages - Stamps are independent of one another, so if an outage affects a single stamp, tenants deployed to other stamps should not be affected. This isolation helps to contain the \'blast radius\' of an incident or outage, enhancing the overall resiliency of the application\\n* Different Versions of the Solution - If there is a need to have some tenants on different versions of your solution at the same time, the Deployment Stamp pattern allows for this flexibility by deploying different stamps with different versions\\n* High-Scale Platforms \u2014 The pattern is suitable for implementing high-scale platforms with users distributed over a wide area. It helps manage the load and ensure that the system can handle a large number of users efficiently. By using the Deployment Stamp pattern in these scenarios, you can achieve better scalability, isolation, and resiliency for your application.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e NaturalLimitsOnScalability{Natural Limits on Scalability?}\\n  NaturalLimitsOnScalability -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Deployment Stamp pattern]\\n  NaturalLimitsOnScalability -- No --\x3e TenantIsolation{Tenant Isolation?}\\n  TenantIsolation -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  TenantIsolation -- No --\x3e MultiRegionApplications{Multi-Region Applications?}\\n  MultiRegionApplications -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  MultiRegionApplications -- No --\x3e ResiliencyDuringOutages{Resiliency During Outages?}\\n  ResiliencyDuringOutages -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  ResiliencyDuringOutages -- No --\x3e DifferentVersionsOfSolution{Different Versions of the Solution?}\\n  DifferentVersionsOfSolution -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  DifferentVersionsOfSolution -- No --\x3e HighScalePlatforms{High-Scale Platforms?}\\n  HighScalePlatforms -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  HighScalePlatforms -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use Deployment Stamp pattern]\\n```\\n\\n##### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udea2 Bulkhead\\n\\n> In a bulkhead architecture, elements of an application are isolated into pools so that if one fails, the others will continue to function.\\n\\nThe Bulkhead pattern is a type of application design that is tolerant of failure. In a bulkhead architecture, elements of an application are isolated into pools so that if one fails, the others will continue to function. It\'s named after the sectioned partitions (bulkheads) of a ship\'s hull. If the hull of a ship is compromised, only the damaged section fills with water, which prevents the ship from sinking. A cloud-based application may include multiple services, with each service having one or more consumers. Excessive load or failure in a service will impact all consumers of the service. Partition service instances into different groups, based on consumer load and availability requirements. This design helps to isolate failures and allows you to sustain service functionality for some consumers, even during a failure.\\n\\nThe Bulkhead pattern and the Deployment Stamp pattern are both architectural patterns used to improve the resiliency and scalability of applications, but they address different concerns and are implemented in different ways, for example, the Deployment Stamp isolates entire instances of applications, each with its own services, the bulkhead partner isolates different components or services within the same application or system and is primarily focuses on fault isolation and resource management within a single deployment. These patterns can work together for a highly resistant solution.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Patterns - Bulkhead](Blog_CloudDesignPatternsBulkhead.gif)\\n\\n##### Issues & considerations\\n\\nThe Bulkhead pattern is designed to improve the resiliency of an application by isolating different parts of the system to prevent a failure in one part from cascading to others. Here are the key issues and considerations when implementing the Bulkhead pattern\\nIssues\\n\\n* Resource Exhaustion - If a service or consumer fails or becomes misconfigured, it can exhaust resources such as connection pools, memory, or CPU. This can prevent other services or consumers from functioning properly.\\n* Cascading Failures - Without isolation, a failure in one service can lead to cascading failures, affecting the entire system. This can happen if a single service consumes all available resources, leaving none for other services.\\n* Complexity - Implementing the Bulkhead pattern adds complexity to the system. It requires careful planning and management of resource allocation and isolation.\\n* Less Efficient Use of Resources - Isolating resources for different services or consumers can lead to less efficient use of resources. For example, some resources might remain underutilized while others are overutilized\\nConsiderations\\n* Partitioning Services and Consumers \u2014 Services and consumers should be divided into different groups based on load and availability requirements. This helps isolate failures and maintain service functionality for some consumers even during a failure.\\n* Resource Allocation - Allocate separate resources (e.g., connection pools, memory) for each service or consumer. This ensures that a failure in one service does not affect the resources available to other services.\\n* Granularity of Bulkheads - Determine the appropriate level of granularity for bulkheads. For example, you could isolate resources at the service level, consumer level, or even at the tenant level.\\n* Combining with Other Patterns - Consider combining the Bulkhead pattern with other fault-handling patterns such as retry, circuit breaker, and throttling to provide more sophisticated fault handling.\\n* Technology Overhead - Evaluate the overhead in terms of cost, performance, and manageability when partitioning services or consumers into bulkheads. For example, using containers can offer a good balance of resource isolation with fairly low overhead.\\n* Monitoring and SLA - Monitor the performance and SLA of each partition to ensure that the isolation is effective and that resources are being used efficiently.\\n* Critical vs. Standard Consumers - Isolate critical consumers from standard consumers to ensure that critical operations can continue even if standard operations fail.\\n* Security\u2014The segmentation between components helps constrain security incidents to the compromised bulkhead, enhancing the overall security of the system. By addressing these issues and considerations, the Bulkhead pattern can help improve the resiliency and reliability of your application, ensuring that failures are contained and do not affect the entire system.\\n\\n##### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe Bulkhead pattern is particularly useful in the following scenarios\\n\\n* Isolating Resources for Backend Services - Use the Bulkhead pattern to isolate resources used to consume a set of backend services. This is especially important if the application can provide some level of functionality even when one of the services is not responding\\n* Isolating Critical Consumers from Standard Consumers - Implement the Bulkhead pattern to isolate critical consumers from standard consumers. This ensures that critical operations can continue even if standard operations fail\\n* Protecting the Application from Cascading Failures - The Bulkhead pattern helps protect the application from cascading failures. By isolating different parts of the system, a failure in one part does not affect the entire system\\n* Handling Resource Exhaustion - When a service or consumer fails or becomes misconfigured, it can exhaust resources such as connection pools, memory, or CPU. The Bulkhead pattern helps to prevent this by isolating resources for different services or consumers\\n* Maintaining Service Functionality During Failures - The Bulkhead pattern allows you to sustain service functionality for some consumers even during a failure. By partitioning service instances into different groups based on consumer load and availability requirements, you can isolate failures and maintain service functionality\\n* Combining with Other Fault-Handling Patterns - Consider combining the Bulkhead pattern with other fault-handling patterns such as retry, circuit breaker, and throttling to provide more sophisticated fault-handling\\n* Deploying Services with Different Quality of Service - The Bulkhead pattern allows you to deploy services that offer a different quality of service for consuming applications. For example, a high-priority consumer pool can be configured to use high-priority services. By using the Bulkhead pattern in these scenarios, you can improve the resiliency and reliability of your application, ensuring that failures are contained and do not affect the entire system.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e IsolatingResources{Isolating Resources for Backend Services?}\\n  IsolatingResources -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Bulkhead pattern]\\n  IsolatingResources -- No --\x3e IsolatingCriticalConsumers{Isolating Critical Consumers from Standard Consumers?}\\n  IsolatingCriticalConsumers -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  IsolatingCriticalConsumers -- No --\x3e ProtectingFromCascadingFailures{Protecting the Application from Cascading Failures?}\\n  ProtectingFromCascadingFailures -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  ProtectingFromCascadingFailures -- No --\x3e HandlingResourceExhaustion{Handling Resource Exhaustion?}\\n  HandlingResourceExhaustion -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  HandlingResourceExhaustion -- No --\x3e MaintainingServiceFunctionality{Maintaining Service Functionality During Failures?}\\n  MaintainingServiceFunctionality -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  MaintainingServiceFunctionality -- No --\x3e CombiningFaultHandlingPatterns{Combining with Other Fault-Handling Patterns?}\\n  CombiningFaultHandlingPatterns -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  CombiningFaultHandlingPatterns -- No --\x3e DeployingServicesDifferentQoS{Deploying Services with Different Quality of Service?}\\n  DeployingServicesDifferentQoS -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  DeployingServicesDifferentQoS -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use Bulkhead pattern]\\n```\\n\\n##### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Container Instances](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-instances/container-instances-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), and [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n#### \ud83d\ude0a Compensating Transaction\\n\\n> If one or more of the steps fail, you can use the Compensating Transaction pattern to undo the work that the steps performed.\\n\\nWhen you use an eventually consistent operation that consists of a series of steps, the Compensating Transaction pattern can be useful. Specifically, if one or more of the steps fail, you can use the Compensating Transaction pattern to undo the work that the steps performed. Typically, you find operations that follow the eventual consistency model in cloud-hosted applications that implement complex business processes and workflows. Applications that run in the cloud frequently modify data. This data is sometimes spread across various data sources in different geographic locations. To avoid contention and improve performance in a distributed environment, an application shouldn\'t try to provide strong transactional consistency. Rather, the application should implement eventual consistency. In the eventual consistency model, a typical business operation consists of a series of separate steps. While the operation performs these steps, the overall view of the system state might be inconsistent. But when the operation finishes and all the steps have run, the system should become consistent again. The data that are affected by an operation that implements eventual consistency isn\'t always held in a database. For example, consider a service-oriented architecture (SOA) environment. An SOA operation can invoke an action in a service and cause a change in the state that\'s held by that service. \\n\\nTo undo the operation, you also have to undo this state change. This process can involve invoking the service again and performing another action that reverses the effects of the first.\\n\\nThe solution is to implement a compensating transaction. The steps in a compensating transaction undo the effects of the steps in the original operation. An intuitive approach is to replace the current state with the state the system was in at the start of the operation. But a compensating transaction can\'t always take that approach, because it might overwrite changes that other concurrent instances of an application have made. Instead, a compensating transaction must be an intelligent process that takes into account any work that concurrent instances do. This process is usually application-specific, driven by the nature of the work that the original operation performs.\\n\\n\\n![Cloud Design Pattern - Compensating Transaction](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_CompensatingTransaction.gif)\\n\\n##### Issues & considerations\\n\\nWhen implementing the Compensating Transaction pattern, there are several issues and considerations to keep in mind\\n\\n* Determining Failure - It might not be easy to determine when a step in an operation that implements eventual consistency fails. A step might not fail immediately but could get blocked. Implementing a time-out mechanism can help identify such failures\\n* Complexity of Compensation Logic - Compensation logic is often application-specific and relies on the application having sufficient information to undo the effects of each step in a failed operation. Generalizing this logic can be challenging\\n* Idempotency - Define the steps in a compensating transaction as idempotent commands. This ensures that the steps can be repeated if the compensating transaction itself fails, which is crucial for maintaining consistency\\n* Resilience and Reliability - The infrastructure handling the steps must be resilient both in the original operation and in the compensating transaction. It should not lose the information required to compensate for a failing step and must reliably monitor the progress of the compensation logic\\n* State Restoration - A compensating transaction doesn\'t necessarily return the system data to its state at the start of the original operation. Instead, it compensates for the work that the operation completed successfully before it failed\\n* Order of Steps - The order of the steps in the compensating transaction isn\'t necessarily the exact opposite of the steps in the original operation. For example, one data store might be more sensitive to inconsistencies than another, so the steps that undo changes to this store should occur first\\n* Concurrency and Parallelism - It might be possible to perform some of the undo steps in parallel, depending on how the compensating logic is designed for each step. This can help speed up the compensation process\\n* Manual Intervention - In some cases, manual intervention might be the only way to recover from a step that has failed. The system should raise an alert and provide as much information as possible about the reason for the failure\\n* Resource Locking - To increase the likelihood of overall activity success, you can place a short-term, time-out\u2013based lock on each resource required to complete an operation. Obtain these resources in advance and perform the work only after acquiring all the resources, finalizing all actions before the locks expire\\n* Retry Logic - Implement retry logic that is more forgiving than usual to minimize failures that trigger a compensating transaction. If a step in an operation fails, handle the failure as a transient exception and repeat the step. Stop the operation and initiate a compensating transaction only if a step fails repeatedly or can\'t be recovered. By considering these issues and implementing appropriate strategies, you can effectively manage the complexities associated with compensating transactions and ensure the reliability and consistency of your application.\\n\\n##### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe Compensating Transaction pattern should be used in the following scenarios.\\n\\n* Undoing Operations in Eventual Consistency Models - Use this pattern to undo operations that implement the eventual consistency model. This is particularly useful when you need to maintain data consistency across distributed systems\\n* Handling Failures in Long-Running Transactions - When dealing with long-running transactions that involve multiple steps, the Compensating Transaction pattern can be used to undo the effects of each step if the transaction fails at any point. This ensures that the system can recover gracefully from failures\\n* Ensuring Reliability and Resilience - Implement this pattern to address malfunctions in critical workload paths by rolling back data changes, breaking transaction locks, or executing native system behavior to reverse the effect. This helps make the workload resilient to malfunctions and ensures it recovers to a fully functioning state after a failure\\n* Complex Business Processes and Workflows - Use the Compensating Transaction pattern in cloud-hosted applications that implement complex business processes and workflows. This pattern helps in managing eventual consistency and ensuring that the system can handle failures effectively\\n* Avoiding the Complexity of Distributed Transactions - When it is not feasible to use distributed transactions due to their complexity and overhead, the Compensating Transaction pattern can be an alternative. It allows you to break down a distributed transaction into separate, compensable tasks\\n* Handling State Changes in Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) - In an SOA environment, where operations can cause changes in the state held by services, the Compensating Transaction pattern can be used to undo these state changes if necessary\\n* Manual Intervention and Recovery - In cases where manual intervention might be required to recover from a failed step, the Compensating Transaction pattern can be used to raise alerts and provide information about the failure, allowing for manual recovery actions using the Compensating Transaction pattern in these scenarios, you can ensure that your system can handle failures gracefully, maintain data consistency, and recover from errors effectively.\\n\\n##### Azure Solutions\\n\\nCustomers use a travel website to book itineraries. A single itinerary might consist of a series of flights and hotels. A customer who travels from Seattle to London and then on to Paris might perform the following steps when creating an itinerary:\\n\\n1. Book a seat on flight F1 from Seattle to London.\\n2. Book a seat on flight F2 from London to Paris.\\n3 Book a seat on flight F3 from Paris to Seattle.\\n4. Reserve a room at Hotel H1 in London.\\n5. Reserve a room at Hotel H2 in Paris.\\n\\nThese steps constitute an eventually consistent operation, although each step is a separate action. In addition to performing these steps, the system must also record the counter operations for undoing each step. This information is needed in case the customer cancels the itinerary. The steps necessary to perform the counter operations can then run as a compensating transaction.\\n\\nIn many business solutions, failure of a single step doesn\'t always necessitate rolling back the system by using a compensating transaction. For example, consider the travel website scenario. Suppose the customer books flights F1, F2, and F3 but can\'t reserve a room at Hotel H1. It\'s preferable to offer the customer a room at a different hotel in the same city rather than canceling the flights. The customer can still decide to cancel. In that case, the compensating transaction runs and undoes the bookings for flights F1, F2, and F3. But the customer should make this decision, not the system.\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-csharp&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Logic Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), and [Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n### Security Patterns\\n\\n![Security Patterns](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_Security.PNG)\\n\\n#### \ud83d\ude0a Backends for Frontends\\n\\n> Create separate backend services to be consumed by specific frontend applications or interfaces. \\n\\nThe Backends for Frontends (BFF) pattern involves creating separate backend services tailored to specific frontend applications or interfaces. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to avoid customizing a single backend for multiple interfaces, which can lead to conflicting requirements and development bottlenecks. An application may initially target a desktop web UI, with a backend service developed to support it. As the user base grows, a mobile application might be developed that needs to interact with the same backend. However, the capabilities and requirements of mobile devices differ significantly from desktop browsers, leading to competing requirements for the backend.

These differences can lead to competing requirements for the backend, making it challenging to serve both interfaces effectively\\n* Development Bottlenecks - The backend can become a bottleneck in the development process due to the need to accommodate conflicting update requirements from different front-end teams. This can result in significant effort being spent on maintaining a single deployable resource that serves multiple frontends\\n* Complexity in Maintenance - Maintaining separate backends for each frontend can increase the complexity of the system. Each backend needs to be updated and maintained independently, which can lead to increased operational overhead \\nConsiderations\\n* Segmentation and Isolation - The BFF pattern introduces segmentation and isolation by creating separate backend services for each frontend. This reduces the surface area of the API and limits lateral movement among different backends, which might expose different capabilities\\n* Tailored Security and Authorization - The separation allows for tailored security and authorization mechanisms for each front end. This ensures that the security requirements for each frontend are addressed effectively, potentially reducing the surface area of an API\\n* Optimized Interfaces - By creating separate backends for each client, you can expose an optimal interface for that client. This allows for different payload sizes or interaction patterns that are specific to the needs of each front, improving performance and user experience\\n* Reduced Attack Surface - The BFF pattern reduces the attack surface by limiting the functionality exposed by each backend to only what is necessary for its corresponding front end. This minimizes the potential for security vulnerabilities \\n* Enhanced Monitoring and Control - The separation of backends allows for more granular monitoring and control over each service. Security incidents can be contained within the specific backend, reducing the blast radius of any potential compromise\\n* Compliance and Regulatory Requirements - Different frontends might have different compliance and regulatory requirements. The BFF pattern allows for these requirements to be addressed individually, ensuring that each backend complies with the necessary standards By considering these issues and implementing appropriate strategies, you can effectively manage the complexities associated with the Backends for Frontends pattern and ensure the reliability, security, and performance of your application.\\n\\n##### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe Backends for Frontends (BFF) pattern should be used in the following scenarios.\\n\\n* Different Client Requirements - When different types of clients, such as mobile applications and desktop web browsers, require different payload sizes or interaction patterns, the BFF pattern is useful. It allows you to create separate backends for each client, which exposes an optimal interface for that client\\n* Avoiding Backend Bottlenecks - If the backend service becomes a bottleneck due to conflicting update requirements from different frontend teams, the BFF pattern can help. By creating separate backend services for each frontend, you can reduce the effort spent on maintaining a single deployable resource that serves multiple frontends\\n* Competing Requirements - When the capabilities of different frontends (e.g., mobile devices vs. desktop browsers) differ significantly, leading to competing requirements for the backend, the BFF pattern can address these differences. It allows each backend to be optimized for the specific needs of its corresponding frontend\\n* Security and Authorization - The BFF pattern is beneficial when you need to tailor security and authorization mechanisms for each front end. By individualizing the service layer for each front, you can reduce the surface area of the API and limit lateral movement among different backends, which might expose different capabilities\\n* Optimized Interfaces - When you need to expose an optimal interface for each client, the BFF pattern is appropriate. This allows for different payload sizes or interaction patterns that are specific to the needs of each frontend, improving performance and user experience. Using the Backends for Frontends pattern in these scenarios, you can effectively manage the complexities associated with serving multiple frontends, ensure optimal performance, and enhance the security of your application.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e DifferentClientRequirements{Different Client Requirements?}\\n  DifferentClientRequirements -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use BFF pattern]\\n  DifferentClientRequirements -- No --\x3e AvoidingBackendBottlenecks{Avoiding Backend Bottlenecks?}\\n  AvoidingBackendBottlenecks -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  AvoidingBackendBottlenecks -- No --\x3e CompetingRequirements{Competing Requirements?}\\n  CompetingRequirements -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  CompetingRequirements -- No --\x3e SecurityAndAuthorization{Security and Authorization?}\\n  SecurityAndAuthorization -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  SecurityAndAuthorization -- No --\x3e OptimizedInterfaces{Optimized Interfaces?}\\n  OptimizedInterfaces -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  OptimizedInterfaces -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use BFF pattern]\\n```\\n\\n##### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udea7 Gatekeeper\\n\\n> Protect applications and services by using a dedicated host instance to broker requests between clients and the application or service.\\n\\nCloud services expose endpoints that allow client applications to call their APIs. The code used to implement the APIs triggers or performs several tasks, including but not limited to authentication, authorization, parameter validation, and some or all request processing. The API code is likely to access storage and other services on behalf of the client.\\nIf a malicious user compromises the system and gains access to the application\'s hosting environment, its security mechanisms and access to data and other services are exposed. As a result, the malicious user can gain unrestricted access to credentials, storage keys, sensitive information, and other services.\\n\\nThe GateKeeper patterns allow you to protect applications and services by using a dedicated host instance to broker requests between clients and the application or service. The broker validates and sanitizes the requests, and can provide an additional layer of security and limit the system\'s attack surface.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Pattern - Gatekeeper](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_Gatekeeper.gif)\\n\\n##### Issues & considerations\\n\\nThe Gatekeeper pattern is a design pattern used to protect applications and services by acting as an intermediary that validates and sanitizes requests before passing them to the trusted host. Here are the key issues and considerations when implementing this pattern\\n\xa0\\n* Single Point of Failure - The gatekeeper instance could become a single point of failure. If the gatekeeper fails, it can disrupt the entire system. To mitigate this, consider deploying redundant instances and using an autoscaling mechanism to ensure capacity and maintain availability\\n* Performance Impact - Adding the gatekeeper layer introduces additional processing and network communication, which can impact the overall performance of the system. This additional latency needs to be considered, especially for performance-critical applications\\n* Complexity in Implementation - Implementing the gatekeeper pattern adds complexity to the system architecture. It requires careful design to ensure that the gatekeeper effectively validates and sanitizes requests without becoming a bottleneck or introducing new vulnerabilities\\nConsiderations\\n\xa0\\n* Controlled Validation - The gatekeeper should validate all incoming requests and reject those that do not meet the validation requirements. This helps in ensuring that only legitimate requests are processed by the trusted host\\n* Limited Risk and Exposure - The gatekeeper should not have access to the credentials or keys used by the trusted host to access storage and services. This limits the risk and exposure in case the gatekeeper is compromised, as the attacker would not gain access to these sensitive credentials or keys\\n* Appropriate Security - The gatekeeper should run in a limited privilege mode, while the rest of the application runs in full trust mode required to access storage and services. This ensures that even if the gatekeeper is compromised, it cannot directly access the application services or data\\n* Secure Communication - Use secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS, SSL, or TLS) between the gatekeeper and the trusted hosts or tasks. This helps protect the data in transit and ensures that the communication between the gatekeeper and the trusted hosts is secure\\n* Internal or Protected Endpoints - Ensure that the trusted hosts expose only internal or protected endpoints that are used exclusively by the gatekeeper. The trusted hosts should not expose any external endpoints or interfaces to minimize the attack surface\\n* Redundant Instances - To minimize the impact of a failure, deploy redundant instances of the gatekeeper and use an autoscaling mechanism to ensure that there is always sufficient capacity to handle incoming requests\\n* Separation of Concerns - The gatekeeper should not perform any processing related to the application or services or access any data. Its function should be purely to validate and sanitize requests. The trusted hosts might need to perform additional request validation, but the core validation should be done by the gatekeeper. By considering these issues and implementing appropriate strategies, you can effectively manage the complexities associated with the Gatekeeper pattern and ensure the reliability, security, and performance of your application.\\n\\n##### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe Gatekeeper pattern should be used in the following scenarios.\\n\\n* Handling Sensitive Information - When your application handles sensitive information that requires a high degree of protection from malicious attacks, the Gatekeeper pattern is beneficial. It acts as an intermediary that validates and sanitizes requests before they reach the trusted host, thereby protecting sensitive data\\n* High-Security Requirements - If your application exposes services that require robust security measures, such as web application firewalls, DDoS protection, bot detection, and centralized authentication and authorization checks, the Gatekeeper pattern can centralize these security functionalities\\n* Mission-Critical Operations - For applications that perform mission-critical operations that cannot be disrupted, the Gatekeeper pattern ensures that only validated and sanitized requests are processed, reducing the risk of malicious attacks and system failures\\n* Separate Request Validation - When there is a need to perform request validation separately from the main tasks or to centralize this validation to simplify maintenance and administration, the Gatekeeper pattern is appropriate. It ensures that the core validation is done by the gatekeeper, while the trusted hosts might perform additional validation\\n* Reducing Attack Surface - The Gatekeeper pattern is useful when you want to reduce the attack surface of your system. By decoupling the public endpoints from the code that processes requests and accesses storage, the gatekeeper can provide an additional layer of security and limit the system\'s exposure to potential attacks\\n* Secure Communication - When secure communication between clients and the application or service is required, the Gatekeeper pattern can be implemented using secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS, SSL, or TLS) between the gatekeeper and the trusted hosts or tasks\\n* Redundancy and Availability - In scenarios where high availability is crucial, deploying redundant instances of the gatekeeper and using an autoscaling mechanism can ensure that there is always sufficient capacity to handle incoming requests, minimizing the impact of a failure using the Gatekeeper pattern in these scenarios, you can enhance the security, reliability, and performance of your application, ensuring that it meets the necessary protection and operational requirements.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e HandlingSensitiveInformation{Handling Sensitive Information?}\\n  HandlingSensitiveInformation -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Gatekeeper pattern]\\n  HandlingSensitiveInformation -- No --\x3e HighSecurityRequirements{High Security Requirements?}\\n  HighSecurityRequirements -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  HighSecurityRequirements -- No --\x3e MissionCriticalOperations{Mission Critical Operations?}\\n  MissionCriticalOperations -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  MissionCriticalOperations -- No --\x3e SeparateRequestValidation{Separate Request Validation?}\\n  SeparateRequestValidation -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  SeparateRequestValidation -- No --\x3e ReducingAttackSurface{Reducing Attack Surface?}\\n  ReducingAttackSurface -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  ReducingAttackSurface -- No --\x3e SecureCommunication{Secure Communication?}\\n  SecureCommunication -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  SecureCommunication -- No --\x3e RedundancyAndAvailability{Redundancy and Availability?}\\n  RedundancyAndAvailability -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  RedundancyAndAvailability -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use Gatekeeper pattern]\\n```\\n\\n##### Azure Solutions\\n\\nThe Azure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and [Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796). \\n\\n#### \ud83e\udd1d Federated Identity\\n\\n> Delegate authentication to an external identity provider. This can simplify development, minimize the requirement for user administration, and improve the user experience of the application.\\n\\nUsers typically need to work with multiple applications provided and hosted by different organizations they have a business relationship with.\\n\\nImplement an authentication mechanism that can use federated identity. Separate user authentication from the application code and delegate authentication to a trusted identity provider.\\n\\nThis model is often called claims-based access control. Applications and services authorize access to features and functionality based on the claims contained in the token. The service that requires authentication must trust the IdP. The client application contacts the IdP, which performs the authentication.\\n\\nFederated authentication provides a standards-based solution to the issue of trusting identities across diverse domains,\\n\\nThis type of authentication is becoming more common across all types of applications, especially cloud-hosted applications because it supports single sign-on without requiring a direct network connection to identity providers. The user doesn\'t have to enter credentials for every application. This increases security because it prevents the creation of credentials required to access many different applications, and it also hides the user\'s credentials from all but the original identity provider. Applications see just the authenticated identity information contained within the token.\\n\\n![Cloud Design Patterns - Federated Identity](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_FederatedIdentity.gif)\\n\\n##### Issues & considerations\\n\\nWhen implementing the Federated Identity pattern, there are several issues and considerations to keep in mind\\nIssues\\n\xa0\\n* Single Point of Failure - Authentication can become a single point of failure. If the identity provider (IdP) or the Security Token Service (STS) fails, it can disrupt access to all applications relying on it. To mitigate this, consider deploying your identity management mechanism across multiple data centers to maintain reliability and availability\\n* Complexity in Implementation - Implementing federated identity can be complex, especially if retrofitting it into existing applications that were built using different authentication mechanisms. This complexity can make it less cost-effective and more challenging to manage\\n* Performance Impact - The additional steps involved in federated authentication, such as token issuance and validation, can introduce latency. This performance impact needs to be considered, especially for applications requiring high responsiveness\\n* Security Vulnerabilities - Federated identity can expose security vulnerabilities if not properly managed. For example, if a user leaves the company and their account is not immediately deprovisioned, it can lead to unauthorized access. Ensuring timely de-provisioning and robust security practices is crucial\\n* Administrative Overhead - While federated identity can reduce the administrative overhead of managing user credentials within the application, it requires careful management of the relationship with the identity provider. This includes ensuring that the identity provider\'s security practices are robust and that the integration is maintained.\\n\xa0* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Federated identity allows for the implementation of RBAC based on role claims contained in the authentication token. This provides a more granular level of control over access to features and resources within the application\\n* Home Realm Discovery - If there are multiple identity providers configured, the STS must determine which identity provider the user should be redirected to for authentication. This process, known as home realm discovery, can be automated based on various factors such as email address, subdomain, IP address, or cookies\\n* User Experience - Federated identity can improve the user experience by enabling single sign-on (SSO) across multiple applications. Users do not need to remember multiple credentials, which simplifies their interaction with the system and reduces the likelihood of forgotten passwords\\n* Security and Compliance - Offloading user management and authentication to a trusted identity provider can enhance security by leveraging the provider\'s advanced capabilities for identity-based threat detection and prevention. This also helps in meeting compliance requirements without implementing these capabilities in the application itself\\n* Business Continuity - Federated systems typically require a load-balanced array of servers to ensure high availability for authentication requests. This setup helps maintain business continuity by providing redundancy and failover capabilities\\n* Integration with Third-Party Services - Federated identity is useful for integrating with third-party services and applications, especially in scenarios where multiple organizations need to collaborate. It allows users from different organizations to authenticate using their own credentials, simplifying access management. By considering these issues and implementing appropriate strategies, you can effectively manage the complexities associated with the Federated Identity pattern and ensure the reliability, security, and performance of your application.\\n\\n##### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe Federated Identity pattern should be used in the following scenarios.\\n\\n* Single Sign-On in the Enterprise - When you need to authenticate employees for corporate applications hosted in the cloud outside the corporate security boundary, without requiring them to sign in every time they visit an application. This provides a seamless user experience similar to on-premises applications where users authenticate once and gain access to all relevant applications\\n* Federated Identity with Multiple Partners - When you need to authenticate both corporate employees and business partners who do not have accounts in the corporate directory. This is common in business-to-business applications, applications that integrate with third-party services, and scenarios where companies with different IT systems have merged or shared resources\\n* SaaS Applications - For independent software vendors providing a ready-to-use service for multiple clients or tenants. Each tenant can authenticate using a suitable identity provider, such as corporate credentials for business users or social identity credentials for consumers and clients of the tenant\\n* Improving User Experience - When users typically need to work with multiple applications provided and hosted by different organizations, federated identity can simplify the user experience by allowing them to use the same credentials across all applications. This reduces the likelihood of forgotten passwords and provides a more cohesive user experience\\n* Reducing Administrative Overhead - When you want to minimize the administrative overhead of managing user credentials within the application. By delegating authentication to a trusted identity provider, you can simplify development and reduce the need for user administration tasks such as password reminders and account deprovisioning\\n* Enhancing Security - When you need to enhance security by offloading user management and authentication to a trusted identity provider. This can provide advanced capabilities for identity-based threat detection and prevention and ensure that user credentials are managed securely\\n* Supporting Claims-Based Access Control \u2014 When you need to implement role-based access control (RBAC) based on role claims contained in the authentication token, this allows for a more granular level of control over access to features and resources within the application.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e SingleSignOn{Single Sign-On in the Enterprise?}\\n  SingleSignOn -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Federated Identity pattern]\\n  SingleSignOn -- No --\x3e FederatedIdentityWithMultiplePartners{Federated Identity with Multiple Partners?}\\n  FederatedIdentityWithMultiplePartners -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  FederatedIdentityWithMultiplePartners -- No --\x3e SaaSApplications{SaaS Applications?}\\n  SaaSApplications -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  SaaSApplications -- No --\x3e ImprovingUserExperience{Improving User Experience?}\\n  ImprovingUserExperience -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  ImprovingUserExperience -- No --\x3e ReducingAdministrativeOverhead{Reducing Administrative Overhead?}\\n  ReducingAdministrativeOverhead -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  ReducingAdministrativeOverhead -- No --\x3e EnhancingSecurity{Enhancing Security?}\\n  EnhancingSecurity -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  EnhancingSecurity -- No --\x3e SupportingClaimsBasedAccessControl{Supporting Claims-Based Access Control?}\\n  SupportingClaimsBasedAccessControl -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  SupportingClaimsBasedAccessControl -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use Federated Identity pattern]\\n```\\n\\n##### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure services that can be used to implement this pattern include [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/whatis?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and [Microsoft Entra ID External](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/external-id/external-identities-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Gateway Offloading\\n\\n> Offload shared or specialized service functionality to a gateway proxy. \\n\\nThis pattern can simplify application development by moving shared service functionality, such as the use of SSL certificates, from other parts of the application into the gateway. Offload some features into a gateway, particularly cross-cutting concerns such as certificate management, authentication, SSL termination, monitoring, protocol translation, or throttling.\\n\\nIt is similar to the Gatekeeper pattern, which focuses on protecting applications by validating and sanitizing requests, decoupling public endpoints from backend processing, and centralizing security functionalities to limit the system\'s attack surface.\\n\\nThe Gateway Offloading\xa0focuses on offloading cross-cutting concerns and shared functionalities to a gateway to simplify application development and maintenance, enhance security, and ensure consistency in logging and monitoring.\\n\\n![Cloud Design - Gateway Offloading](Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_GatewayOffloading.gif)\\n\\n##### Issues & considerations\\n\\nWhen implementing the Gateway Offloading pattern, there are several issues and considerations to keep in mind\\n\\n* Coupling Across Services - Introducing a gateway can create coupling across services, which might not be suitable for all architectures. This coupling can lead to dependencies that complicate the deployment and scaling of individual services\\n* Single Point of Failure - The gateway itself can become a single point of failure if not properly managed. It is crucial to ensure that the gateway is highly available and resilient to failure by running multiple instances and designing it for the capacity and scaling requirements of the application\\n* Performance Overhead - Offloading functionality to a gateway can introduce performance overhead. The gateway must be designed to handle the additional load without becoming a bottleneck for the application. This includes ensuring that the gateway can scale appropriately to meet the demands of the application\\n* Security Management - Properly handling security issues such as token validation, encryption, and SSL certificate management requires specialized skills. The gateway must be configured and managed by a team with the necessary expertise to ensure that security is not compromised\\n* Administrative Overhead - While offloading shared functionalities to a gateway can reduce administrative overhead in some areas, it can also introduce new administrative tasks. For example, managing and updating SSL certificates or other shared resources at the gateway level requires careful coordination and planning\\n* Consistency in Logging and Monitoring - The gateway can provide consistency in request and response logging and monitoring. However, it is essential to ensure that the gateway is correctly instrumented to provide the necessary level of monitoring and logging, even if individual services are not\\n* Specialized Features - Offloading specialized features such as authentication, authorization, logging, monitoring, or throttling to the gateway allows dedicated teams to manage these features. This can simplify the development and maintenance of the core application but requires coordination between teams to ensure that the offloaded features are correctly implemented and maintained\\n* Business Logic - Business logic should never be offloaded to the gateway. The gateway should only handle cross-cutting concerns that are used by the entire application, such as security or data transfer. Offloading business logic can lead to a tightly coupled architecture that is difficult to maintain and scale. Considering these issues and carefully planning the implementation, you can effectively use the Gateway Offloading pattern to simplify application development, enhance security, and ensure consistency in logging and monitoring.\\n\\n##### When to use this pattern\\n\\nThe Gateway Offloading pattern should be used in the following scenarios.\\n\\n* Shared or Specialized Service Functionality - When you need to offload shared or specialized service functionality, such as SSL certificate management, authentication, authorization, logging, monitoring, or throttling, to a gateway proxy. This can simplify application development by moving these cross-cutting concerns from other parts of the application into the gateway\\n* Reducing Administrative Overhead - When managing shared features across multiple services increases administrative overhead and the likelihood of deployment errors. Offloading these features to a gateway can reduce the need to configure, manage, and maintain them across all services, simplifying updates and reducing the risk of errors\\n* Centralized Security Management - When you need to handle complex security tasks such as token validation, encryption, and SSL certificate management. Offloading these tasks to a gateway allows dedicated teams with specialized skills to manage them, ensuring that security is not compromised\\n* Consistency in Logging and Monitoring - When you want to ensure consistency in request and response logging and monitoring across services. The gateway can be configured to provide a minimum level of monitoring and logging, even if individual services are not correctly instrumented\\n* High Availability and Resilience - When you need to ensure that the gateway is highly available and resilient to failure. Running multiple instances of the gateway and designing it for the capacity and scaling requirements of the application can help avoid single points of failure and ensure that the gateway does not become a bottleneck\\n* Simplifying Configuration and Management - When you want to simplify the configuration and management of supporting resources, such as web server certificates and secure website configurations. Offloading these responsibilities to a gateway can make service upgrades simpler and more manageable\\n* Specialized Team Management - When you want to allow dedicated teams to implement features that require specialized expertise, such as security. This allows your core team to focus on the application functionality, leaving these specialized but cross-cutting concerns to the relevant experts\\n* Network Security and Attack Mitigation - When you need to mitigate attacks at the edge ensure that internet traffic routes only through the gateway, not directly to the workloads or PaaS services. The gateway should have the ability to mitigate exploits and provide network security. By considering these scenarios, you can determine whether the Gateway Offloading pattern is suitable for your application and ensure that it meets the necessary security, user experience, and administrative requirements.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TB\\n  Start(Start) --\x3e SharedOrSpecializedServiceFunctionality{Shared or Specialized Service Functionality?}\\n  SharedOrSpecializedServiceFunctionality -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern[Use Gateway Offloading pattern]\\n  SharedOrSpecializedServiceFunctionality -- No --\x3e ReducingAdministrativeOverhead{Reducing Administrative Overhead?}\\n  ReducingAdministrativeOverhead -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  ReducingAdministrativeOverhead -- No --\x3e CentralizedSecurityManagement{Centralized Security Management?}\\n  CentralizedSecurityManagement -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  CentralizedSecurityManagement -- No --\x3e ConsistencyInLoggingAndMonitoring{Consistency in Logging and Monitoring?}\\n  ConsistencyInLoggingAndMonitoring -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  ConsistencyInLoggingAndMonitoring -- No --\x3e HighAvailabilityAndResilience{High Availability and Resilience?}\\n  HighAvailabilityAndResilience -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  HighAvailabilityAndResilience -- No --\x3e SimplifyingConfigurationAndManagement{Simplifying Configuration and Management?}\\n  SimplifyingConfigurationAndManagement -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  SimplifyingConfigurationAndManagement -- No --\x3e SpecializedTeamManagement{Specialized Team Management?}\\n  SpecializedTeamManagement -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  SpecializedTeamManagement -- No --\x3e NetworkSecurityAndAttackMitigation{Network Security and Attack Mitigation?}\\n  NetworkSecurityAndAttackMitigation -- Yes --\x3e UsePattern\\n  NetworkSecurityAndAttackMitigation -- No --\x3e DoNotUsePattern[Do not use Gateway Offloading pattern]\\n```\\n\\n##### Azure Solutions\\n\\nAzure resources that can be used to implement this pattern include [Azure Front Door with WAF](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), [Azure Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and [Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/firewall/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n\\n### \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Architecting for Azure\\n\\nThe following Frameworks can help guide you, from the business requirements to the technical implementation of your solution:\\n\\n1.

If you don\'t know how to do that, you can follow the official Microsoft Learn documentation here: [Create a new Git repo in your project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/create-new-repo?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796). \\n\\nOnce your repository has been set up and initialized, we need to add the following files.\\n\\n# \ud83d\udcbb PowerShell Script\\n\\nThe PowerShell script, `Export-AzDevOpsRepos.ps1`, is responsible for cloning all repositories in a given Azure DevOps organization and downloading them as ZIP files. It uses the Azure DevOps REST API to fetch all projects and their respective repositories. For each repository, it generates a URL to download the repository as a ZIP file and saves it to a local directory. If the script is run in an Azure Pipelines environment, it also uploads the directory containing the downloaded repositories as a pipeline artifact.\\n\\n:::tip\\nThe PowerShell script can also be run locally. If it detects an Azure DevOps agent, it will automatically collect the variables from the pipeline variables; otherwise, those variables can be added manually to the script to run it locally.\\n\\n```powershell\\nif ($env:AGENT_ID) {\\n    # Running in Azure DevOps\\n    $personalAccessToken = \\"$env:pat\\" # Assuming PAT is stored as a secret variable in the pipeline\\n    $organization = \\"$env:AzDevOpsOrg\\"\\n\\n}\\nelse {\\n    # Running on a local PC\\n    $personalAccessToken = \'\'\\n    $organization = \'\'\\n}\\n```\\n:::\\n\\n# \ud83d\ude80 Azure Pipelines\\n\\nThe Azure Pipelines configuration file, `.azure-pipelines/pipeline.ci.adoexport.yml` sets up a CI pipeline that runs the PowerShell script on a schedule. The pipeline is configured to run on the latest Windows agent. It uses the Azure CLI task to run the PowerShell script and to manage access to an Azure storage account. After the script has run, the pipeline downloads any ZIP files produced as artifacts and copies them to the Azure storage account.

It streamlines the process, automating critical tasks like infrastructure provisioning and resource optimization. It intelligently selects the optimal hardware configuration for your specific model, using available CPU and GPU resources on AKS. KAITO eliminates the manual setup complexities, accelerating your deployment time and reducing associated costs.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc40 Overview\\n\\n:::info\\n[Kaito](https://github.com/Azure/kaito) is an operator that automates the deployment of the AI/ML inference model in a Kubernetes cluster. The target models are popular open-sourced inference models such as Falcon and llama2. Kaito has the following critical differentiations compared to most of the mainstream model deployment methodologies built on top of virtual machine infrastructures:\\n\\n* Manage large model files using container images. An HTTP server is provided to perform inference calls using the model library.\\n* Avoid tuning deployment parameters to fit GPU hardware by providing preset configurations.\\n* Auto-provision GPU nodes based on model requirements.\\n* Host large model images in the public Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) if the license allows.\\n\\nKaito follows the classic Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition(CRD)/controller design pattern. The user manages a workspace custom resource that describes the GPU requirements and the inference specification. Kaito controllers automate the deployment by reconciling the workspace custom resource.\\n\\n![Kaito - Architecture](kaito-arch.png)\\n\\n* Workspace controller: It reconciles the workspace custom resource, creates machine custom resources to trigger node auto-provisioning, and creates the inference workload (deployment or stateful set) based on the model preset configurations.\\n* Node provisioner controller: The controller\'s name is gpu-provisioner in [Kaito helm chart](https://github.com/Azure/kaito/tree/main/charts/kaito/gpu-provisioner). It uses the machine CRD originated from Karpenter to interact with the workspace controller. It integrates with Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS) APIs to add new GPU nodes to the AKS cluster. Note that the gpu-provisioner is an open-sourced component. It can be replaced by other controllers if they support Karpenter-core APIs.\\n\\n> At the time of this article, [Kaito is in preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/public-preview-kubernetes-ai-toolchain-operator-kaito-addon-for-aks/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and **is not recommended for production use**.\\n\\nThere are some significant benefits of running open-source LLMs with Kaito. Some advantages include:\\n\\n* Automated GPU node provisioning and configuration: Kaito will automatically provision and configure GPU nodes for you. This can help reduce the operational burden of managing GPU nodes, configuring them for Kubernetes, and tuning model deployment parameters to fit GPU profiles.\\n* Reduced cost: Kaito can help you save money by splitting inferencing across lower-end GPU nodes, which may also be more readily available and cost less than high-end GPU nodes.\\n* Support for popular open-source LLMs: Kaito offers preset configurations for popular open-source LLMs. This can help you deploy and manage open-source LLMs on AKS and integrate them with your intelligent applications.\\n* Fine-grained control: You can fully control data security and privacy, model development and configuration transparency, and fine-tune the model to fit your specific use case.\\n* Network and data security: You can ensure these models are ring-fenced within your organization\'s network, and the data never leaves the Kubernetes cluster.\\n:::\\n\\n:::warning\\nA word of warning: when looking at running your model in your own AKS cluster, be aware of the [AI Shared responsibility model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility-ai?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796). There is a difference in the Azure AI PaaS *(Platform as a Service)* offerings, i.e., Model safety, compute, versioning, etc. and running your model in your own AKS cluster. So, although the Kaito operator helps you run some SLM models in your AKS cluster, you are responsible for the security, compliance, and governance of the entire system versus consuming a Microsoft-provided model as a service offering.\\n:::\\n\\n:::info\\nIf you want to follow the guide and set up Kaito, make sure you have approved [quota](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) in your region for the GPU compute nodes. In this example, I am using a 12 vCPU Standard NCSv3 instance.\\n\\nYou can use the following Azure CLI command to check your use and limit:\\n\\n~~~bash\\naz vm list-usage \\\\\\n  --location ${AZURE_LOCATION} \\\\\\n  --query \\"[? contains(localName, \'Standard NCSv3\')]\\" \\\\\\n  -o table\\n~~~\\n\\nYou can follow this Microsoft guide for requesting a quota increase: [Request a quota increase](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quotas/regional-quota-requests?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n:::\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc36 Example App - Pets\\n\\nToday, we will use the [aks store demo\u2014Pets](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo) sample microservices app, commonly used for AKS demos, tutorials, and experiments. We will deploy it to our AKS cluster, update it to use a locally hosted mistral model to generate the local product descriptions, and then call the externally hosted Azure OpenAI endpoint.\\n\\n> This sample demo app consists of containerized microservices that can be easily deployed into an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. It is meant to show a realistic scenario using a polyglot architecture, event-driven design, and common open-source back-end services *(e.g., RabbitMQ, MongoDB)*. The application also leverages OpenAI\'s GPT-3 models to generate product descriptions. This can be done using either Azure OpenAI or OpenAI.\\n\\n![Demo Pets - Architecture with Azure OpenAI](demo-arch-with-openai.png)\\n\\nThe application has the following services: \\n\\n| Service | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| `makeline-service` | This service handles processing orders from the queue and completing them (Golang) |\\n| `order-service` | This service is used for placing orders (Javascript) |\\n| `product-service` | This service is used to perform CRUD operations on products (Rust) |\\n| `store-front` | Web app for customers to place orders (Vue.js) |\\n| `store-admin` | Web app used by store employees to view orders in queue and manage products (Vue.js) | \\n| `virtual-customer` | Simulates order creation on a scheduled basis (Rust) |\\n| `virtual-worker` | Simulates order completion on a scheduled basis (Rust) |\\n| `ai-service` | Optional service for adding generative text and graphics creation (Python) |\\n| `mongodb` | MongoDB instance for persisted data |\\n| `rabbitmq` | RabbitMQ for an order queue |\\n\\n### \ud83d\ude80 Overview\\n\\n### \ud83d\udce6 Prerequisites\\n\\n* [GitHub account](https://github.com/) *(we will use a GitHub Codespace to deploy the App, and requirements)*\\n* [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/open-source?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) *(we will need an Azure subscription, to install the cluster the model to)*\\n* [Request a quota increase](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quotas/regional-quota-requests?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) for a GPU compute workload *(ie Standard NCSv3)* in your region. I am based in New Zealand so that I will be deploying to Australia East.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc1d Deploy AKS cluster\\n\\n1. Let us deploy our Cluster and application using a pre-created Azure Developer CLI infrastructure as code deployment by connecting to the Codespace *(which already has the dependencies of Azure Developer CLI, Kubectl, Helm, Azure Bicep, and Terraform Azure CLI pre-installed)* at [aks store demo\u2014Pets](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo).\\n![Open Codespace](Kaito-AKS_Codespace_Open.gif)\\n2. Now, we need to prep for the Azure Developer CLI deployment, which will use Terarform (a random pet name module for a unique name) to deploy our AKS cluster in our specified region. So, let\'s log in to Azure.\\n\\n```bash\\n# login to Azure CLI\\naz login --use-device-code\\n\\n# login to Azure Developer CLI\\nazd auth login\\n```\\n\\n![Codespace Azure Login](Kaito-AKS_Codespace_AzLogin.gif)\\n\\n3. Once logged in, we can configure a new Azure Developer CLI environment in preparation for our deployment.\\n\\n```bash\\nazd env new\\n```\\n\\n4. Enter an environment name *(i.e., Kaito)*; the Azure Developer CLI uses this to store the environment settings for the deployment and won\'t reflect any of your deployed resources.\\n5. Now, we need to set a few environment variables for our deployment, which will be used by the Terraform deployment to deploy the Azure Open AI instance that Pets will use *(and we will replace it with Falcon later on; however, I recommend including it in the deployment to confirm that the OpenAI components are confirmed working first)*.\\n\\n```bash\\nazd env set DEPLOY_AZURE_OPENAI true\\nazd env set DEPLOY_AZURE_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY true\\n```\\n\\nTo confirm variables, you can run the following:\\n\\n```bash\\nazd env get-values\\n```\\n\\n![Check Azure Developer CLI variables](Kaito-AKS_Codespace_CheckAzdEnvVariables.gif)\\n\\n6. Finally, it\'s time to deploy. Run the following command and select the Subscription you want to deploy the AKS cluster into and the region *(remember this region is the region for which you have requested the GPU quota increase)*.\\n\\n```bash\\nazd up\\n```\\n\\n![Azure Developer CLI -Up](Kaito-AKS_Codespace_AZDUp.gif)\\n\\n7. Once the deployment is complete, you will see the output (AKS and helm deployments for the PET microservices), including the AKS cluster name, the Azure OpenAI endpoint, and the OIDC issuer URL.\\n\\nAfter you have provided the information, the azd up command will start by registering Azure providers and features and installing Azure CLI extensions. From there, it will invoke the terraform apply command and execute \\"azd-hook\\" scripts, which is a neat way for you to \\"hook\\" into the deployment process and add any customizations. We will invoke a helm install command in our deployment to apply our Kubernetes manifests.\\n\\nThis will take a few minutes to complete. Once it\'s done, you will see the terraform apply command output and the created resources. You can also view the resources in the Azure portal.\\n\\n![AKS Pet store Azure resource deployments](Kaito-AKS-rg-funnyrhino17.png)\\n\\n7. Once the deployment is complete, run the following command to load all the AZD environment variables into your shell to be used by the Kaito deployment.\\n\\n```bash\\neval \\"$(azd env get-values)\\"\\n```\\n### \ud83e\uddea Test the Pet-store app\\n\\nNow, lets test that its working, by taking a look at the pet store admin public endpoint.\\n\\n1. Open your favorite browser and navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)\\n2. Search for Kubernetes services\\n3. Find your AKS cluster and click on the resource\\n4. Click on Services and Ingresses\\n5. Find the store-admin service and click on the public endpoint to open the store-admin page.\\n6. You can test the current *(external to the AKS cluster)* Azure OpenAI endpoint by clicking on Products, Add Product, typing in a Keyword, clicking on the \\"Ask AI Assistant\\" button, and seeing the generated text.\\n\\n![AKS - Test Pet store admin OpenAI endpoint](Kaito-AKS_PetStoreAdminAzOpenAITest.gif)\\n\\n### \ud83d\udc26 Implement Kaito and Falcon LLM\\n\\nNow that the AKS cluster is deployed and the Pets store app is running, we can implement Kaito and run the Falcon 7b-instruct large language model.\\n\\n> You can continue to set this up in the Codespace; I am going to switch to an [Azure CloudShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) to complete the rest of the implementation, mainly to come at the implementation, from the point of view of installing Kaito in an existing cluster, not related to the Pet store example *(i.e., make sure that there are no variables, etc. that we might be reliant on, without knowing why)*. \\n\\n:::info\\nResearchers from Technology Innovation Institute, Abu Dhabi, introduced the [Falcon series](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16867.pdf), which includes models with 7 billion, 40 billion, and 180 billion parameters. These models, intended to be causal decoder-only models, were trained on a high-quality, varied corpus mostly obtained from online data. Falcon-180B, the largest model in the series, is the only publicly available pretraining run ever, having been trained on a dataset of more than 3.5 trillion text tokens.\\n\\nThe researchers discovered that Falcon-180B shows great advancements over other models, including PaLM or Chinchilla. It outperforms models being developed concurrently, such as LLaMA 2 or Inflection-1. Falcon-180B achieves performance close to PaLM-2-Large, which is noteworthy given its lower pretraining and inference costs. With this ranking, Falcon-180B joins GPT-4 and PaLM-2-Large as the leading language models in the world. For more information, see the following resources:\\n\\n* [The Falcon Series of Open Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16867.pdf)\\n* [Falcon-40B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct)\\n* [Falcon-180B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-180B)\\n* [Falcon-7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b)\\n* [Falcon-7B-Instruct](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-kaito-terraform/blob/main/alcon-7B-Instruct)\\n\\nReference: [Deploy Kaito on AKS using Terraform](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-for-isv-and-startups/deploy-kaito-on-aks-using-terraform/ba-p/4108930?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n:::\\n\\n1. To do this, we need to make sure that we have the preview version of the AKS CLI extension installed. You can check this by running the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\naz extension list --query \\"[?name==\'aks-preview\']\\"\\n```\\n\\nIf you don\'t have it, you can install it:\\n\\n```bash\\naz extension add --name aks-preview --allow-preview true\\n```\\n\\nAnd if needed, update it:\\n\\n```bash\\naz extension update --name aks-preview --allow-preview true\\n```\\n2. Re-login to Azure, if needed *(you don\'t need to login to the Azure Developer CLI; it was only required for previous steps)*. Next, we need to register the AIToolchainProvider resource provider by running the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\naz feature register --namespace \\"Microsoft.ContainerService\\" --name \\"AIToolchainOperatorPreview\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis will allow the Kaito (AI Toolchain Operator) APIs on your Azure subscription to be deployed into your AKS cluster. It could take a few minutes to register.\\n\\n![Register AI Tool Chain Operator](Kaito-AKS_RegisterAIToolChainOperator.gif)\\n\\n3. Once the registration is complete, we can prepare to deploy the workload identity, workspace, and GPU-enabled node pool for Kaito; as part of this, we need to define the environment variables (if you are still using the Codespace, these should be carried over from the previous deployment; if not, we can set them)*. Adding the variables helps us avoid having to enter the values each time we run a command.\\n\\n```bash\\nexport AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=\\"9b06e177-a5bb-468b-9fd6-fc58e5b67239\\"\\nexport AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=\\"rg-funnyrhino17\\"\\nexport AZURE_LOCATION=\\"australiaeast\\"\\nexport CLUSTER_NAME=\\"aks-funnyrhino17\\"\\n```\\n\\n![Set Kaito environment variables](Kaito-AKS_Variables.gif)\\n\\n4. We are now going to update our AKS cluster to enable the Kaito operator and OpenID Connect issuer *(required to enable connectivity to a Managed identity to create the Node pools)* by running the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\naz aks update --name ${CLUSTER_NAME} --resource-group ${AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP} --enable-oidc-issuer --enable-ai-toolchain-operator\\n```\\n\\n![Update AI Toolchain Operator](Kaito-AKS_EnableAIToolChainOperatorExistingCluster.gif)\\n\\n5. Once updated, we can then connect directly to the cluster using the Kubernetes command line tool, Kubectl, by running the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\naz aks get-credentials --resource-group ${AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP} --name ${CLUSTER_NAME}\\n```\\n\\n![Connect to AKS cluster with Kubectl](Kaito-AKS_ConnectAKSClusterKubectl.gif)\\n\\n6. Then verify the connection:\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl get nodes\\n```\\n![Kubectl get nodes](Kaito-AKSKubectlgetnodes.gif)\\n\\n:::tip\\n`kubectl` is a command line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.

How this is used is application-specific, but in this example, the Federated credentials are used by an AI Service running on an AKS cluster to talk to an Azure OpenAI instance that the User Assigned Managed identity has access to.\\n\\n![Federated Credentials](UserManagedIdentityEditFederatedCredential.gif)\\n\\n:::warning\\nIt is worth knowing that to use Federated Credentials and open the OIC APIs on your cluster, you will need to either create a new cluster or update it. The OIC APIs are not open by default on the cluster. See [Create an OpenID Connect provider on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-oidc-issuer?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) for more information.\\n:::\\n\\nFirst up is:\\n\\n**Cluster Issue URL**, in my example, I have:\\n  \\n  ```plaintext\\n  https://australiaeast.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/\\n  ```\\n  So what is this? This is the URL of the OpenID Connect provider with which the AKS cluster is federating. It is also the URL that the AKS cluster will use to authenticate the User Assigned Managed identity.\\n\\n  To get the URL, you can use the Azure CLI and run the following query:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  az aks show -n myAKScluster -g myResourceGroup --query \\"oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl\\" -otsv\\n  ```\\n  \\nTo test that it is responding and open, you can navigate to the URL discovery endpoint \'/openid/v1/jwks\', for example:\\n\\nhttps://australiaeast.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/openid/v1/jwks\\n\\nYou will get an HTTP response back similar to the following:\\n\\n  ```plaintext\\n{\\n  \\"keys\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"use\\": \\"sig\\",\\n      \\"kty\\": \\"RSA\\",\\n      \\"kid\\": \\"4gZVAbix5cXrHnMF9D6rp-EOpB92gfamRWVG873e9s5\\",\\n      \\"alg\\": \\"RS256\\",\\n      \\"n\\": \\"wCZChNTi7ymXkmLeMP95PUl-9b2Fnzm1xLlslLw4Cc_1oMVbvNUbJS6r4_bgylTYSowUCqQLZUPH_DClav4aJC-G3OYlCkQrG3wFnB7b70Q8qJrwsVr2XaYh8lwfah_BceiDEJNc2yjjEBQoHs3zbi3qOVhYp3_BYHVoXuBJnhEgMb5bpxzgN-ZrM2QwmLzLSv9BB_iq034B3P0Exn8n0yWvXPFe_pWPzwyC_l4dgMN_TpNMLjaBYoJ-wdfim7eEJuOgVfuV1O8smMeXhUNUoRKOvFNw9H2qjZM243JhVBnLX1C7Oj_8L2AW7wSptuThl-gIqy9nrcSPT_oHhVUwAgO-gwFCRSgilFiBhsG9-wkflSdELeJCRpLi1j_8OOON0LTX6vZrHjwGzGa0bC5zgouKCFE1iNtVc3HoNKczZL-wiERUIgo8YKey_uOdeOtdBPOLVO0igfN4xtDZnxb_CzSUJ3fJHGAg03k3MBEpr0KAMmhsTSo-KUqfcgnclHkOywGdwnX-oT43SvcItEDbUiKyFV-i0CabAVebzF4O6r_ovpK4N2QJ-4s8_bHx4d3RMstML1D_yEpy40PeFjQq5ZPQQt1AUfkT1jP5-siCdJgm8HTc0zIPwfZfwKdKefYMRmamNHwk3TNV9gdOX0fnKP07R9FBKCgypqeDcLYZYgMt\\",\\n      \\"e\\": \\"AQAB\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\"use\\": \\"sig\\",\\n      \\"kty\\": \\"RSA\\",\\n      \\"kid\\": \\"wQ4TGh1obxJ6l8nxEiV-hf-lccLnJwXxx7Rw8E-UDBo\\",\\n      \\"alg\\": \\"RS256\\",\\n      \\"n\\": \\"ydxfJlP6Qmh_dfkhWkrGQrrad-o0ShvZCShIUz4-k8bhH98xAhSgC52EmXnbCvkbDxHpwQIZ8GQHFGjbFC-Z-ZbdIpETd-MVwp70HXyoejuFNmdghTeLZaN5Q-lf1U8gjnxfzUo5tL_Vwcd1RhGi3YXwQmiEGJoZ5ZWhQs75O8iAnvyOzDqWt0CxraIAVPoY9aJ1IBTPlA0bIdDtuCTiynCMQiozO4dx72BDMjJ3ZcEwKrFZBFAu71SPr4xs7ErUYqZFtZxmcDxKkhTNCPd9dUkmo6uknMuVSHj5OqeXexDdKhZKcJhTFBGF89oWtIjx0ix9G8VTqTJsDZp3_LBcs6Ob0hpfyaGePhibZTqhDXD_Nr3p-yw78lXO0ceD1xz8ZJyY4EzxtY2yobAGGNsg_wU23XJsIkJLOGiCAjRg81PxbtlEPzClXkxbrZTjKI9OVJxujGxt01PmgiLN38piThL3zsvGF_4N-ApX1fpdKH9Owl2xsmVd-zzzoJ1l8y9FKZpgnJKQ-VECIbVNwzO6KEm2f7O6MKpqB5hLi-QPH-ZLk3zbi_55zb8h1PZxmuam4rS3MHi98IxxmVz8fbMVirosQhzP7oYuM-L1ZgZLzwKvDenmoUYIfzwUl6QCsM3DxZs_07sxUrZk0isNvBHU3wXKsCtSXJyf0CJyq6TAYCD1\\",\\n      \\"e\\": \\"AQAB\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n  ```\\n\\nHowever, for the Federated credential configuration for AKS, the OIC URL from the Azure CLI `az aks show` command is enough.\\n\\nSecond is the **Namespace**. This is the Namespace in which the User Assigned Managed identity will be used. In my example, I have \'pets\' as this is my Application namespace. Be as specific as you can.\\n\\nIn Kubernetes, a namespace organizes and isolates resources within a cluster. It acts as a virtual cluster within the main cluster. Namespaces allow you to group related objects (such as pods, services, and deployments) together and provide a scope for resource names.\\n\\nThird is the **Service Account**. This Service Account will be linked to the Federated credential inside of AKS.\\n\\nA service account is an identity used by pods (containers) running within a namespace to authenticate with other services or APIs. Each namespace can have multiple service accounts, and they are associated with specific permissions. When a pod is created, it can be assigned a service account. The pod then uses the credentials associated with that service account to access other resources (e.g., secrets, APIs). Service accounts are useful for controlling access and ensuring that pods have the appropriate permissions.\\n\\nThat leaves the **Subject identifier**. This is the Subject identifier.\\n\\nIn AKS Federated credentials, the subject identifier refers to the identity the managed identity will trust. When using workload identity, the subject identifier is typically the service account associated with a pod. The subject identifier establishes trust between the managed identity (related to the AKS cluster) and the service account (associated with the pod). Once this trust is established, the managed identity can securely use the service account\u2019s credentials to access other Azure services.\\n\\nNamespaces provide isolation, service accounts represent identities for pods, and subject identifiers (usually service accounts) are used in federated credentials to establish trust between the managed identity and Kubernetes workloads.\\n\\nUnder the Credentials details, we have **Name** and **Audience**.\\n\\nThe **name** refers to the identifier associated with a managed identity or service principal in Azure. In AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), when configuring federated credentials using managed identities, you create a managed identity (or use an existing one) to represent your AKS cluster. This managed identity is assigned a unique name, which is used to identify it within Entra ID. For example, creating a managed identity named \u201cmy-aks-cluster-identity\u201d becomes the name associated with the identity.\\n\\nThe **audience** (also known as the \u201caud\u201d claim) is a critical part of security tokens (such as JWTs) issued by Azure AD. In the context of AKS federated credentials, the audience represents the intended recipient of the token. When a pod in AKS requests an access token (e.g., to access Azure Key Vault secrets), the audience is set to the specific Azure resource (e.g., Key Vault) the pod wants to access. The audience ensures that the token is valid only for the specified resource. For example, if a pod seeks to access a secret stored in Azure Key Vault, the audience in the token will be set to the Key Vault\u2019s endpoint.\\n\\nThe `api://AzureADTokenExchange` audience is typically used when a service needs to obtain a token to act on behalf of a user or another service. For example:\\n\\n- A user logs in to a web application (front-end), and the application needs to call an API (back-end) on behalf of the user.

[FinOps principles](https://www.finops.org/framework/principles/) can be key.\\n\\n[Tags](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) can be key to help you showback/chargeback costs and help you assign resource owners.\\n\\nRecommended Tags for a Sandbox environment could be:\\n\\n- \\"costCenter\\": \\"sandbox\\"\\n- \\"costModel\\": \\"show-back\\"\\n- \\"environment\\": \\"sandbox\\"\\n- \\"resourceowner\\": \\"your_name\\"\\n- \\"project\\": \\"sandbox_project\\"\\n\\nAlthough the Sandbox environment is for learning, you still need to be aware of its associated costs and keep these as lean as possible.\\n\\nYou can also implement Cost Management and Governance workbooks that allow Sandbox users access to interactive dashboards to help them understand their costs and usage.\\n\\n- [Governance workbook](https://microsoft.github.io/finops-toolkit/governance-workbook) - Monitor the governance posture of your Azure environment. Leverage recommendations to address compliance issues.\\n- [Cost optimization workbook](https://microsoft.github.io/finops-toolkit/optimization-workbook) - Give your engineers a single pane of glass for cost optimization with this handy Azure Monitor workbook.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcb0 Budgets\\n\\nImplement [Budgets](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-acm-create-budgets?tabs=psbudget&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) for each Sandbox, assigned to the Sandbox owner.\\n\\nMonthly resource spending should be forecast initially and amended as the footprint changes.\\n\\nBudget alerts are set up to highlight unplanned spending, not to prevent it _(i.e., they are alerting thresholds, not limits)_.\\n\\nEach Sandbox environment could start with a consistent Budget and can be adjusted IF required as an exception.\\nBudgets are intended to drive Sandbox owners to keep their costs under control by having the information on hand.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd12 Security Baseline\\n\\nSecurity is a key concern for any environment, and the Sandbox environment is no different; however, there are some tradeoffs. The key to a successful Sandbox environment is that it\'s an environment for learning, so the level of security you would adopt should be less. However, there are some stop gaps that should be implemented.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Defender for Cloud\\n\\n[Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) is a cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) that consists of security measures and practices designed to protect cloud-based applications from various cyber threats and vulnerabilities.\\n\\n![Defender for Cloud](defender-for-cloud-pillars.png)\\n\\nDefender for Cloud should be enabled on all Sandboxes to help protect against threats and increase visibility. It is a great learning tool.\\n\\nAs people learn how to use Azure technologies, they may not necessarily know how to secure them or how their services might be adapted for a more secure environment. Defender for Cloud helps increase the knowledge around resources in alignment with [current security best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/alerts-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n> \\"While the security team is responsible for improving the security posture, team members might not actually implement security recommendations.\\n> Using governance rules driven by the security team helps you to drive accountability and an SLA around the remediation process.\\"\\n\\n:::tip\\n[Governance rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/governance-rules?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) are key.\\n:::\\n\\nFor example, using Tags, you could assign resource owners to resources and help drive accountability, alerts, and remediation. Defender for Cloud can be a great learning tool by informing your Sandbox users of potential security issues.\\n\\nYou should also consider possible scenarios, such as the Sandbox environment being one method to exfiltrate data, so make sure you look at [Purview](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and [data sensitivity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-data-sensitivity?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcdc Azure Policy\\n\\n[Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies enforce different rules and effects over your resources so those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements.\\n\\n:::tip\\nI highly recommend that you deploy your policies and initiatives using [Azure Enterprise Policy as Code](https://azure.github.io/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/).\\n:::\\n\\nThere are tradeoffs with the type of Azure policies you deploy in a Sandbox environment vs what you would deploy in your Production or even Dev/Test environment; recommended policies as a base I would recommend are:\\n\\nReference: [ALZ policies](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/blob/main/docs/wiki/ALZ-Policies.md)\\n\\n| Assignment Name                    | Definition Name                                  | Policy Type                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Effect(s) |\\n| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |\\n| **Enforce ALZ Sandbox Guardrails** | **Enforce policies in the Sandbox Landing Zone** | `Policy Definition Set,` **Custom** | This initiative will help enforce and govern subscriptions that are placed within the Sandbox Management Group.

Policies included: <ul><li>Deny the deployment of new resources</li><li>Deploy an auto VM shutdown policy at UTC 00:00</li></ul> | Enforce   |\\n\\nThe Decommissioned Management group is where you would move your Sandbox subscriptions once they are no longer required and you want to decommission them.\\n\\n![Azure Policy - Azure Landing Zones - Initiative](AzurePolicy_ALZSandboxIniiative.png)\\n\\nKey policies are part of the ALZ Sandbox Guardrails, which are essentially the policies to restrict the deployment of network resources. These policies would allow you to link virtual networks to on-premises, peer-to-peer virtual networks and allow Sandbox users to connect to production virtual networks or virtual networks outside your organization\'s control.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcdc Terms of use\\n\\nMake sure you don\'t forget about the People/Processes of your sandbox. You should implement Terms of Use for the Sandbox environment so that users understand the rules and regulations of the environment, such as \'Do not store Production data\'.\\n\\nYou can combine this directly into the Azure Portal login experience by using [Microsoft Entra terms of use](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/terms-of-use?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n![Microsoft Entra - Terms of use](user-tou.png)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd04 Resource Consistency\\n\\nResource Consistency is key. It ensures that resources are configured consistently to manage onboarding, drift, discoverability, and recovery risks.\\n\\nThis is where a lot of automation comes into play to prevent drift and inconsistencies in creating (and decommissioning) a Sandbox environment.\\n\\n![Azure DevOps Pipeline - Sandbox](ResourceConsistency_SBX_ADOPipelines.png)\\n\\nIdeally, you would have a user interface where a user could request a Sandbox environment _(I will talk more about this in the deployment acceleration section)_, which would trigger an Azure DevOps pipeline or GitHub action, as an example, to create the environment.\\n\\nUsing Infrastructure as Code _(IaC)_, you can ensure that the environment is consistent and repeatable and can be provisioned and decommissioned.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcda Enterprise Policy as Code\\n\\n[Enterprise Policy as Code or EPAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/policy-management/enterprise-policy-as-code?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) for short comprises a number of scripts which can be used in CI/CD based system or a semi-automated use to deploy Policies, Policy Sets, Assignments, Policy Exemptions and Role Assignments.\\n\\n:::info\\nThis is a solution created by Microsoft employees but without Microsoft\'s official support as an open-source initiative.\\n:::\\n\\nEPAC is designed for organizations with a large number of Policies, Policy Sets, and Assignments. It is also designed for organizations with multiple tenants and/or environments. The solution primarily consists of PowerShell scripts intended to run operations such as policy planning, deployment, and sync of external policies, such as Enterprise Landing Zone policies, into the EPAC repo.\\n\\nEnterprise Policy as Code can also be used to control exemptions. An example is running this nightly; any policies or exemptions not in the repository are removed.\\n\\nEnterprise Policy as Code could be used for Sandbox environments, providing an opportunity to clean up outdated policies, assignments, and exemptions and maintain consistency.\\n\\n![Enterprise Policy as Code - Sandbox](SandboxPolicy_EPAC.gif)\\n\\nFeel free to refer a blog post, I did previously on [Enterprise Policy as Code, with Azure DevOps](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/enterprise-policy-code-azure-devops/).\\n\\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Azure DevOps/GitHub\\n\\n[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) or [GitHub](https://github.com/), both offer features, such as Boards/Discussions, Code Repos, Pipelines _(or Actions)_ which can be used as a platform, for IaC _(Infrastructure as Code)_ and CI/CD _(Continous Integration and Continous Deployment)_, and is definitely recommended to be factored in your Sandbox design, when it comes to automation and desired state of your Sandbox environment.\\n\\nThe following automation recommendations assume you have access to Azure DevOps or GitHub _(or similar)_.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udfbc Symphony\\n\\nA large part of the Sandbox vending is a DevOps pipeline and connectivity to Azure that allows Terraform and the pipeline in Azure DevOps to connect to make changes in Azure. Terraform is the car, and Symphony is the road that it travels on.\\n\\n[Symphony](https://github.com/microsoft/symphony) is a framework and set of patterns and best practices for developing, testing, and deploying infrastructure on Azure using Infrastructure as Code _(IAC)_ It includes modern DevOps practices for IAC such as Main and Pull Request workflows, IaC Code Validation & Linting, Automated Testing, Security Scanning, Multi-environment deployments, modules dependencies and more. A mature workflow for IAC not only automates the deployment of the IAC resources but also incorporates engineering fundamentals, resource validation, dependency management, test execution, security scanning, and more.\\n\\nThe Symphony pipelines for Azure DevOps and Terraform, for example, are:\\n\\n| Pipeline Name                        | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\\n| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| pipeline.ci.terraform.yml            | This YAML file defines a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for Azure DevOps, which triggers changes to the main branch, sets up certain variables, and executes several stages, including validation of configuration and preview deployment using Terraform templates.

Both are declarative, meaning you define the desired state of your infrastructure and the tool figures out how to make it so. Bicep is more focused on Microsoft Azure, while Terraform is more focused on multi-cloud.\\n\\nFor this article, I will focus on Terraform, based purely on work done with it around Sandbox provisioning and decommissioning. The Terraform state file helps with a lot of the Sandbox decommissioning aspect.\\n\\nTerraform modules that can be used during Sandbox provisioning are:\\n\\n| Name                     | Link                                                                                                                                           |\\n| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| azuread                  | [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azuread/latest](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azuread/latest)           |\\n| azurerm                  | [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest)           |\\n| random                   | [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/random/latest)             |\\n| time                     | [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/time/latest](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/time/latest)                 |\\n| Azure/lz-vending/azurerm | [https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/lz-vending/azurerm/latest](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/lz-vending/azurerm/latest) |\\n\\nThe real foundation of Sandbox vending is the [Azure/terraform-azurerm-lz-vending](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-lz-vending) Terraform module.\\n\\nIt can be used to create Azure resources according to the landing zone _(Sandbox)_ vending pattern. It can be used to provision resources such as subscriptions, management group associations, role assignments, and virtual networks.\\n\\nHere is an example _(partial snippet of an overall solution)_ of how you COULD use the module by having multiple YAML files per Sandbox and using a for_each loop to create each Sandbox environment:\\n\\n```hcl\\n# This module is used to create resources in Azure according to the landing zone vending pattern.\\n\\nmodule \\"lz_vending\\" {\\n  # The source and version of the module.\\n  source  = \\"Azure/lz-vending/azurerm\\"\\n  version = \\"4.0.2\\"\\n\\n  # The for_each loop allows us to create multiple instances of this module, one for each item in the landing_zone_data_map.\\n  for_each = local.landing_zone_data_map\\n\\n  # The location where the resources will be created.\\n  location = var.location\\n\\n  # Subscription variables.\\n  # Enables the resource provider creation\\n  subscription_register_resource_providers_enabled = true\\n  # The map of resource providers to register.\\n  subscription_register_resource_providers_and_features = var.subscription_register_resource_providers_and_features\\n  # Enables the creation of a subscription alias.\\n  subscription_alias_enabled = true\\n  # The billing scope for the subscription.\\n  subscription_billing_scope = \\"/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/0000000/enrollmentAccounts/${each.value.billing_enrollment_account}\\"\\n  # The display name for the subscription.

A policy defines the rules or guardrails for assigning access to an access package. Each policy can be used to ensure that only the appropriate users can have access to assignments. Access is time-limited and will expire if not renewed.\\n\\n![Access Packages](Azure_Sandbox_IAM_AccessPackages.png)\\n\\nYou can use Access packages to grant access to your Sandbox environment and then remove access when the environment is no longer required.\\n\\nAccess Packages can be used to delegate access to each Sandbox environment to its owner. This allows Sandbox owners, who may have financial delegation, to control who has access to their environment and remove that access when no longer required.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd12 Conditional Access\\n\\nMake sure you factor Conditional Access into your Sandbox design by making sure that only the users who may be using compliant devices or from trusted networks can access the environment.\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 Deployment Acceleration\\n\\n### \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Onboarding self-service\\n\\nOnboarding of a new Sandbox environment could be automated from start to end, using a self-service portal.

It is built on top of Kubernetes and provides a simple, fully managed experience for deploying containerized applications.\\n:::\\n\\n### \ud83e\udd14 Monoliths, Microservices and Containers? Huh?\\n\\nTo understand why we might need Container Apps, we need to go back to some of the elements of software development. \\n\\nContainers can be a valuable tool for deploying and managing microservices, but they are not always necessary. Let\'s explore why you may not need containers for microservices and how they can generally help.\\n\\nMicroservices architecture is a software development approach where an application is built as a collection of small, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with other microservices through well-defined APIs.\\n\\n:::info\\nWhile containers are not always necessary for deploying microservices, they offer benefits such as isolation, portability, scalability, and deployment consistency. Evaluating your specific requirements, existing infrastructure, and resource constraints will help determine whether containers are the right choice for your microservices architecture, and is intended to help you understand how it could be used, especially around some of the Cloud Native integration components.\\n:::\\n\\n**Why you may not need containers for microservices:**\\n\\n* Simplicity: If your microservices are developed using a single programming language or framework and can be easily deployed on traditional servers or virtual machines, containers may not be necessary. In such cases, deploying microservices directly on servers or virtual machines can be simpler and more straightforward.\\n* Existing Infrastructure: If you already have a well-established infrastructure with efficient deployment processes and tools in place, containers may not be required. Leveraging your existing infrastructure can save time and effort in adopting and managing container technologies.\\n* Resource Constraints: Containers introduce additional overhead in terms of resource utilization. If you have limited resources or strict resource constraints, deploying microservices directly on servers or virtual machines may be more efficient.\\n\\n**However, how containers can generally help with microservices:**\\n\\n* Isolation: Containers provide a lightweight and isolated runtime environment for each microservice. This isolation ensures that changes or issues in one microservice do not affect others, improving overall system stability.\\n* Portability: Containers encapsulate the dependencies and runtime environment required by a microservice, making it highly portable. Microservices packaged as containers can be easily deployed and run on different platforms, such as local development machines, cloud environments, or on-premises servers.\\n* Scalability: Containers enable easy scaling of microservices. With container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, you can dynamically scale the number of containers running a specific microservice based on demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization.\\n* Deployment Consistency: Containers provide a consistent deployment model, ensuring that the microservice runs the same way across different environments. This consistency simplifies the deployment process and reduces the chances of configuration-related issues.\\n\\n\\nFirst, let\'s take a look at Monoliths.\\n\\n#### \ud83c\udfe2 Monoliths\\n\\n![Azure Container Apps - What is a Monolith?](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingWhatIsAMonolith.PNG)\\n\\n\\"In software engineering, a monolithic application is a single unified software application that is self-contained and independent from other applications but typically lacks flexibility\\"\u2014Wikipedia.\\n\\n![Monolith shortcomings](ACA_Overview_Monolith_Shortcomings.PNG)\\n\\nGenerally, monolithic architectures suffer from drawbacks that can delay application development and deployment. These drawbacks become especially significant when the product\'s complexity increases or when the development team grows in size.\\n\\nThe codebase of monolithic applications can be difficult to understand because it may be extensive. This can make it difficult for new developers to modify the code to meet changing business or technical requirements. \\n\\nAs requirements evolve or become more complex, it becomes difficult to correctly implement changes without hampering the code\'s quality and affecting the application\'s overall operation.\\n\\n\ud83d\udcd6 References: \\n\\n* [monolithic architecture](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/monolithic-architecture)\\n* [Challenges and patterns for modernizing a monolithic application into microservices](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/challenges-and-patterns-for-modernizing-a-monolithic-application-into-microservices/)\\n* [Microservices with Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/microservices?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n\\nNext up is Microservices, a more modular approach to software development.\\n\\n#### \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Microservices\\n\\nAt its core, the concept of the microservices architecture is an approach to application development in which a large application is built as a collection of modular and cooperating services. \\n\\nHowever, in order to successfully achieve a robust microservices architecture, the underlying infrastructure must also be correctly designed. In fact, due to the distributed nature of the microservices architecture, the line between what used to be separate application details and implementation details grows blurrier.\\n\\nContainers simplify the continuous deployment of microservices.\\n\\n![What are Microservices](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingWhatIsMicroservices.PNG)\\n\\n\ud83d\udcd6 References: \\n\\n* [Of Microservices & Containers](https://hackernoon.com/https-medium-com-spruha-pandya-of-microservices-containers-6f0ea25dac3)\\n\\n#### \ud83d\ude80 Deployment modes\\n\\nThe deployment of microservices and traditional monolith applications is usually done separately, which is an oversimplification.\\n\\n![Monolith shortcomings](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingMonolithMicroservices.gif)\\n\\n| Aspect | Microservices | Monolith Application |\\n|--------|---------------|----------------------|\\n| Service instantiation | Instantiate services instead of spinning up new machines => faster | Spinning up new machines for each instance => slower |\\n| Hardware utilization | Better utilization of hardware | Less efficient utilization of hardware |\\n| Cost | Optimized cost due to efficient resource usage | Potentially higher cost due to inefficient resource usage |\\n| Time to market | Lower time to market: more confident when it comes to upgrading a service | Higher time to market: less confident when it comes to upgrading a service |\\n| Independence | Services are independently implemented, deployed, scaled, and versioned | All components are tightly coupled and scaled together |\\n\\n**So, let\'s take a look at how Microservices and Containers can work together.**\\n\\nLet\u2019s delve into the differences between\xa0microservices\xa0and\xa0containers:\\n\\n| Aspect | Microservices | Containers |\\n|--------|---------------|------------|\\n| Definition | Microservices are an architectural style that breaks down an application into small, autonomous services. These services communicate via well-defined interfaces using lightweight APIs. | A container is a technology that bundles an application along with all its dependencies into a package. This package allows the application to be deployed consistently across different environments, abstracting away differences in operating systems and underlying infrastructure. |\\n| Structure | Microservices are self-contained and encapsulate their logic. They interact through well-defined interfaces, allowing independent development and deployment. | Containers ride on a host operating system, similar to virtual machines (VMs), but they share the OS kernel. This makes them lighter and faster to boot than VMs. Containers are hosted on a container runtime, which enables multiple containers (each several megabytes in size) to run on a single server. |\\n| Popular Tools | Microservices can be developed with various programming languages and frameworks. | Docker is a well-known commercial container management solution, while Kubernetes (often referred to as K8s) is a widely used free and open-source container management system. |\\n| Pros | Enhance maintainability, testability, and scalability. Organized around business capabilities and are typically owned by small teams. | Excellent for packaging and deploying applications consistently, regardless of the environment. More lightweight and faster to boot than VMs. |\\n| Cons | Complexity in managing multiple services. Need for coordination and communication between services. | Requires knowledge of container management and orchestration tools. Potential security risks if not properly isolated. |\\n| Use Case | Suitable for building modular, scalable applications. | Provides the infrastructure for running microservices, ensuring consistent deployment and management across different environments. |\\n\\n![microservices\xa0and\xa0containers](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingMicroservicesandContainers.PNG)\\n\\nContainers provide the infrastructure for running microservices, ensuring consistent deployment and management across different environments.\xa0Microservices, on the other hand, define the architectural approach for building modular, scalable applications.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f Container orchestration\\n\\n:::info\\nContainer orchestration is required to transition from deploying containers individually on a single host, to deploying complex multi-container apps on many machines. It requires a distributed platform, independent from infrastructure, that stays online through the entire lifetime of your application, surviving hardware failure and software updates.\\n:::\\n\\n![Container orchastration](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingContainerOrchastration.PNG)\\n\\nExisting Container orchestration solutions include the following:\\n\\n| Solution | Description | Pros | Cons |\\n|----------|-------------|------|------|\\n| Kubernetes | An open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. | Highly flexible and customizable. Large community support. | Complexity in setup and management. |\\n| Docker Swarm | Docker\'s own native container orchestration. | Easy to set up. Integrated into Docker CLI. | Limited functionality compared to Kubernetes. |\\n| Amazon ECS | A highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers. | Deep integration with AWS services. | Only available on AWS. |\\n| Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) | Managed Kubernetes service provided by Azure. | Deep integration with Azure services. Managed Kubernetes with less operational complexity. | Only available on Azure. |\\n| Azure Container Apps | A serverless container service that enables you to run containerized applications at scale. | Serverless, event-driven, and supports Linux containers. Deep integration with Azure services. | Only available on Azure. |\\n\\n**So, what is Container orchestration?**\\n\\n![Container orchastration](ACA_Overview_WhatisContainerOrchastration.gif)\\n\\nContainer orchestration\xa0plays a crucial role in managing and scaling containerized applications. Here are some reasons why it\u2019s essential:\\n\\n| Feature | Description |\\n|---------|-------------|\\n| Scaling and Load Balancing | Container orchestration tools like Kubernetes allow you to dynamically scale your application by adding or removing containers based on demand. Load balancing ensures that incoming requests are distributed evenly across containers, preventing overload on any single instance. |\\n| High Availability | Orchestration ensures that your application remains available even if individual containers fail. It automatically restarts failed containers or replaces them with healthy ones. |\\n| Service Discovery and DNS | Containers come and go, making it challenging to keep track of their IP addresses. Orchestration tools provide service discovery and DNS resolution, allowing containers to find each other by name. |\\n| Rolling Updates and Rollbacks | When deploying new versions of your application, orchestration allows for rolling updates. You can gradually replace old containers with new ones, minimizing downtime. In case of issues, you can easily roll back to a previous version. |\\n| Configuration Management | Orchestration tools manage environment variables, secrets, and other configuration settings for containers. This centralizes configuration management and ensures consistency. |\\n| Resource Optimization | Orchestration optimizes resource utilization by scheduling containers efficiently across nodes. It balances CPU, memory, and storage requirements. |\\n| Networking and Security | Orchestration handles networking, including creating virtual networks for communication between containers. It also manages security policies, access controls, and network segmentation. |\\n| Monitoring and Logging | Container orchestration platforms provide monitoring dashboards and logs. You can track performance, troubleshoot issues, and gain insights into your application. |\\n\\nContainer orchestration simplifies deployment, enhances reliability, and ensures efficient management of containerized applications.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udc51 Container Apps\\n\\n[Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\xa0is a\xa0serverless platform\xa0that simplifies running containerized applications\\n\\n1.

Azure delivers app portability to support business growth powered by open source in the Kubernetes ecosystem. \\n:::\\n\\nAzure Container Apps is built on a foundation of powerful open-source technology to deliver the same microservices benefits as Kubernetes as a fully managed and serverless app hosting option. Behind the scenes, every container app runs on Azure Kubernetes Service, with Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA), Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr), and Envoy deeply integrated in the hosting service. However, developers and operators are not exposed to this underlying Kubernetes infrastructure. The open-source-centric approach enables a path for teams to build microservices without having to overcome the concept and operational overhead of working with Kubernetes directly and enables continued app portability by leveraging open standards and APIs\\n\\n![Azure Conter Apps and AKS](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingAKSACA.PNG)\\n\\n![Azure Conter Apps and AKS](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingAKS.PNG)\\n\\n![Azure Conter Apps and AKS](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingAKSCompareACA.PNG)\\n\\n## \u26a1Building Azure Container Apps\\n\\nNow that we know where Azure Container Apps fits in the Cloud Native ecosystem let\'s take a look at potential tools for building Azure Container Apps.\\n\\n![Building Azure Container Apps](ACA_Overview_BuildingContainerAppsApps.PNG)\\n\\n### \ud83d\ude80 Azure Container App Deployment options\\n\\nAlthough anything that can connect to the Azure APIs can essentially create a [Container App Environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/environment?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), common tools are:\\n\\n* [Azure Portal Deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/quickstart-portal?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Azure CLI deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/containerapp-up?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [ARM template deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/azure-resource-manager-api-spec?tabs=arm-template&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Bicep template deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.app/containerapps?pivots=deployment-language-bicep&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Terraform template deployment](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/container_app)\\n* [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/azure-native/api-docs/app/containerapp/) or other API tools\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf10 Container App environments\\n\\nBut before you jump into the tools to create, you need to understand what you will be deploying and building, so let us take a look at [Container App Environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/environment?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n:::info\\nA Container app environment is a secure boundary around groups of container apps that share the same virtual network and write logs to the same logging destination.\\n\\nContainer app environments are fully managed, where Azure handles OS upgrades, scale operations, failover procedures, and resource balancing.\\n:::\\n\\n| Reasons to deploy container apps to the same environment | Reasons to deploy container apps to different environments |\\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Manage related services                                   | Two applications never share the same compute resources   |\\n| Deploy different applications to the same virtual network | Two Dapr applications can\'t communicate via the Dapr service invocation API |\\n| Instrument Dapr applications that communicate via the Dapr service invocation API | |\\n| Have applications to share the same Dapr configuration | |\\n| Have applications share the same log analytics workspace | |\\n| Provide an existing virtual network when you create an environment | |\\n\\n![Container App Environment](ACA_Overview_ContainerAppEnvironments.gif)\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udce6 Container Types\\n\\nAzure Container Apps supports two types of Containers.\\n\\nApp Container *(Sidecar)* - The container that runs your application code\\nInit Containers - Containers that run before the app container starts\\n\\n![Azure Container Apps - Container Types](ACA_Overview_BuildingContainerAppContainerTypes.PNG)\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udce6 Container registry\\n\\nAzure Container Apps supports multiple container registries, including:\\n\\n* [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/container-registry?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and other registries.\\n\\nPublic and private registries, i.e., Azure Container Registry, are on a private endpoint.\\n\\n![Azure Container Apps - Container Registries](ACA_Overview_BuildingContainerAppContainerRegistry.PNG)\\n\\n#### \ud83d\udd04 Container Revisions\\n\\n:::info\\nAzure Container Apps implements container app versioning by creating [revisions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/revisions?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796). A revision is an immutable snapshot of a container app version.\\n:::\\n\\nThe first revision is automatically provisioned when you deploy your container app.\\nNew revisions are automatically provisioned when you make a\xa0revision-scope\xa0change to your container app.\\nWhile revisions are immutable, they\'re affected by\xa0application-scope\xa0changes, which apply to all revisions.\\nYou can create new revisions by updating a previous revision.\\nYou can retain up to 100 revisions, giving you a historical record of your container app updates.\\nYou can run multiple revisions concurrently.\\nYou can split external HTTP traffic between active revisions.\\n\\n![Container App Revisions](ACA_Overview_BuildingContainerAppRevisions.PNG)\\n\\n![Container App Revisions](ACA_Overview_ContainerAppRevisions.gif)\\n\\n#### \u23f9\ufe0f Container shutdowns\\n\\nIt\'s worth noting how your Containers will shut down as Azure Container Apps scales your Apps or you deactivate a revision, as this can affect your application.\\n\\nThe containers are shut down in the following situations:\\n\\n* As a container app scales in\\n* As a container app is being deleted\\n* As a revision is being deactivated\\n\\nWhen a shutdown is initiated, the container host sends a SIGTERM message to your container. The code implemented in the container can respond to this operating system-level message to handle termination.\\n\\nIf your application doesn\'t respond within 30 seconds to the SIGTERM message, then SIGKILL terminates your container.\\n\\nAdditionally, make sure your application can gracefully handle shutdowns.

Born at Microsoft in 2019 as an incubation project, it was donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2021 and is now a highly successful open-source project. Dapr helps you write flexible and secure microservices that leverage industry-proven best practices to build connected distributed applications faster. By letting Dapr\u2019s sidecar take care of the complex challenges such as service discovery, message broker integration, encryption, observability, and secret management, you can focus on business logic and keep your code simple.\\n:::\\n\\nDapr is a set of integrated APIs with built-in best practices and patterns to build distributed applications. Dapr increases your developer productivity by 20-40% with out-of-the-box features such as workflow, pub/sub, state management, secret stores, external configuration, bindings, actors, distributed lock, and cryptography. You benefit from the built-in security, reliability, and observability capabilities, so you don\'t need to write boilerplate code to achieve production-ready applications.\\nDapr\'s component model decouples the integrated API with the underlying resources. For instance, when you\'re using the Dapr publish-subscribe API, you can change the message broker by swapping out a yaml component file to switch from RabbitMQ to Kafka (or any other supported broker) without changing your application code.\\n\\n![Dapr High-level](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingDaprIntegrationHigh_Level.PNG)\\n\\n![Dapr Building Blocks](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingDaprIntegrationBuildingBlocks.PNG)\\n\\n![Dapr Sidecar architecture](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingDaprIntegrationSidecar.PNG)\\n\\n![Dapr Sidecar architecture - Container Apps](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingDaprIntegrationSidecarContainerApps.PNG)\\n\\nDapr integration is built into Azure Container Apps, so you can focus on building your application without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Dapr operates as a sidecar alongside your application, providing features only where needed.\\n\\nDapr integration is available straight from the Azure Portal for both the Envirionment and Container App itself.\\n\\n![Azure Container Apps - Dapr Portal Integration](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingDaprIntegrationContainerAppPortalIntegration.gif)\\n\\nAlso, make sure to check out [Dapr component resiliency](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/dapr-component-resiliency?tabs=bicep&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcda KEDA\\n\\n[KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling)](https://keda.sh/) is a Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaling component.\\n\\n:::info\\nKEDA is a Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler. With KEDA, you can drive the scaling of any container in Kubernetes based on the number of events needing to be processed.\\n:::\\n\\n![Azure Container Apps - KEDA](ACA_Overview_UnderstandingKEDAlntegration.png)\\n\\nKEDA (Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling) is an open-source project that provides event-driven autoscaling for Kubernetes workloads. KEDA can scale any container in response to events from various sources such as Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Storage Queues, Azure Storage Blobs, RabbitMQ, Kafka, and more.\\n\\nAn example of KEDA event scaling is being able to scale your Containers based on KEDA scalers, such as Azure DevOps pipelines. You can refer to a previous blog post I did on leveraging KEDA scalers with [Container App Jobs to create Self-Hosted Azure DevOps Agents](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/hosted-agents-container-apps-job/).\\n\\nKEDA really opens up the possibilities of scaling your Containers, based on events, and is a great addition to Azure Container Apps, and like DAPR KEDA is built-in to Azure Container Apps and managed by Microsoft.\\n\\n![KEDA](ACA_Overview_KEDA.gif)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcbb Azure Container Apps Networking & Storage\\n\\nNow, let us talk about Networking and Storage.\\n\\n### \ud83c\udf10 Networking\\n\\n![Azure Container Apps - Networking Overview](ACA_Overview_NetworkArchitecture_HighLevel.PNG)\\n\\n:::info\\n[Azure Container Apps run in the context of an environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), which is supported by a virtual network (VNET). \\n\\nWhen you create an environment, you can provide a custom VNET, otherwise a VNET is automatically generated for you. Generated VNETs are inaccessible to you as they\'re created in Microsoft\'s tenant.\\n\\nTo take full control over your VNET, provide an existing VNET to Container Apps as you create your environment.\\n:::\\n\\n![Azure Container Apps - Networking Overview](ACA_Overview_NetworkArchitecture_HighLevel2.PNG)\\n\\n**Accessibility levels**\\n\\nUsing internal and external accessibility levels, you can configure whether your container app allows public ingress or ingress only from within your VNet at the environment level.\\n\\n![Azure Container Apps - Accessibility levels](ACA_Overview_NetworkAccessibilitylevels.PNG)\\n\\nCustom VNET (Virtual Network) integration\\n\\nIf you want your container app to restrict all outside access, create an\xa0internal Container app environment.\\n\\nWhen you provide your own VNet, you need to provide a subnet that is dedicated to the Container App environment you deploy. This subnet isn\'t available to other services.\\n\\nNetwork addresses are assigned from a subnet range you define as the environment is created.\\n\\nYou can define the subnet range used by the Container Apps environment.\\n\\nYou can restrict inbound requests to the environment exclusively to the VNet by deploying the environment internally.\\n\\n**User-defined routes**\\n\\nUser-defined routes (UDR) and controlled egress through NAT Gateway are supported in the workload profiles environment. These features aren\'t supported in the consumption-only environment.\\n\\n:::info\\nWhen using UDR with Azure Firewall in Azure Container Apps, you need to add certain FQDNs and service tags to the firewall\'s allowlist. To learn more, see [configuring UDR with Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#configuring-udr-with-azure-firewall).\\n:::\\n\\n**Envoy**\\n\\nAzure Container Apps uses [Envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) *(also part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation)* as an edge HTTP proxy. TLS is terminated on the edge, and requests are routed based on their traffic splitting rules, which route traffic to the correct application.\\n\\nAzure Container Apps uses Envoy as a network proxy for all HTTP requests. Envoy provides some capabilities such as:\\n\\n* Scaling to zero: Envoy allows your container apps to scale to zero instances when there is no traffic and scale up when there is demand. Envoy acts as a buffer between the clients and the container apps and handles the cold start latency.\\n* HTTPS redirection: Envoy automatically redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS, ensuring secure communication between the clients and the container apps.\\n* TLS termination: Envoy terminates the transport layer security (TLS) at the edge of the container app environment and forwards the requests to the container apps over plain HTTP. This reduces the overhead of encryption and decryption for the container apps.\\n* Mutual TLS: Envoy supports mutual TLS (mTLS) when you use Dapr as a sidecar for your container apps. mTLS provides an additional layer of security by requiring both the client and the server to present valid certificates for authentication.\\n* Ingress controls: Envoy allows you to configure some ingress controls for your container apps, such as IP restrictions, CORS, WAF, etc.\\n\\n![Azure Container Apps - Envoy](ACA_Overview_NetworkEnvoy.gif)\\n\\n![Azure Container Apps - Network Lockdown](ACA_Overview_Networklockdown.PNG)\\n\\n\ud83d\udcd6 References: \\n\\n* [Networking in Azure Container Apps environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [From Chaos to Clarity: Simplifying Your Networking with Azure Container Apps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/startups-at-microsoft/from-chaos-to-clarity-simplifying-your-networking-with-azure/ba-p/4034625?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [User defined routes (UDR)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=consumption-only-env%2Cazure-cli&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#user-defined-routes-udr)\\n\\n### \ud83d\udcbe Storage\\n\\nA container app has access to different types of storage.

According to the authors, this book is for aspiring Cloud Solution Architects:\\n\\n> If you are a self-motivated IT professional and would like to pursue a career as a solution architect, then \\nthis book is for you. You should have a solid base of traditional software architecture understanding, but not in-depth cloud concepts and design considerations.\\n> This book will also be valuable for anyone who is considering a solution architect role as a potential career field but doesn\u2019t know where to get started. No experience in the cloud architect role is needed to get started.\\n\\nIn order to set the context of my review, I need to give a brief blurb about my own IT Career to give the context of what lense I am reviewing from and what I am looking for in a book like this, my background is Systems/Infrastructure Engineer, then moving into Cloud-based roles, from project delivery/implementation to technical assurance roles, working with third-party service partners to deliver services, and now as a Senior Consultant/Architect *(the New Zealand IT industry, is very much generalised, one day you will be architecting strategic solutions, the next you will be doing infrastructure as code, as an engineer, we need to adapt to fit what needs doing at the time)*, so I am looking for a book that can help me in my career and  role, and also help me to mentor and guide others in their career.\\n\\nThere are 8 Chapters in this book, covering Introduction to the Cloud Solution Architect Role, Pursuing the Cloud Architect Role, Preparing for and after the Offer, and is 124 pages long.\\n\\nI am going to break my review into several areas and look at answering questions such as:\\n\\n1. Does the book provide a clear understanding of the CSA\u2019s role? How well does it explain the evolution of cloud computing?\\n2. Are the educational recommendations practical and accessible? Does the book cover a range of certifications?\\n3. Does the book offer actionable advice for gaining experience? Are the examples and suggestions relevant to current industry standards?\\n4. Is the book offer advice that is up-to-date and industry-specific? How helpful are the resume and interview tips?\\n\\nSo lets take a look and see if the book answers these questions. I don\'t want to give away too much of the book, but hopefully, this review will give you a good idea of what to expect from the book.\\n\\n## Role overview\\n\\nFor the role Overview section, we are going to take a look at the book and see whether it discusses the responsibilities and evolution of a Cloud Solution Architect (CSA).\\n\\n> Question: Does the book provide a clear understanding of the CSA\u2019s role? How well does it explain the evolution of cloud computing?\\n\\nChapters 1 and 2, are dedicated to answering this very question, with Chapter 1: understanding the responsibilities of a Cloud Solution Architect, and Chapter 2: Types of Cloud Solution Architect roles.\\n\\nChapter 1 outlines the evolution of Cloud computing, from the first concepts of what became the internet in the 1960s to the modern-day Cloud within the 2000s. The authors do a very good job of being concise on these details - and vendor agnostic, which is clear throughout the entire book. It\'s worth noting that although the authors have ties to Microsoft as part of their day-to-day roles, they cover Azure, AWS, and Google concepts as well. Cloud Solution Architect is not specific to one Cloud or hyper scaler, and in my opinion, the authors concentrate on that very view - it\'s purely about being able to fill the gap that Cloud architecture has as an Architect.\\n\\nNot only does the Chapter outline the history, but gives insights into core Cloud concepts as well, along with high-level points around the [Microsoft Cloud Adoption](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and [Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/well-architected/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\nRegarding a CSA (Cloud Solution Architect) role, the book outlines the upsides and downsides of the role and some of the responsibilities that come with it, across elements from on-premises, IaaS *(Infrastructure as a Service)*, PaaS *(Platform as a Service)* and SaaS *(Software as a Service)*, including various architectural patterns that CSAs need to know.\\n\\nOne of the highlights of the role overview Chapter is that the authors have distilled the role of \'Cloud Solution Architect\', which could mean different things to different people - a very open-ended job title, into the various sub-categories that exist for CSAs and organisations such as Microsoft adhere to, such as Cloud Solution Architect (Infrastructure), Cloud Solution Architect (Applications), Cloud Solution Architect (Data and AI), and Cloud Solution Architect (Security) etc., highlighting the differences in these particular roles, including tools and relevant certifications for each Architect function.\\n\\n**Overall, these Chapters do a good job of setting the scene for the rest of the book, give a good overview of the role and the responsibilities that come with it, and, in my opinion, clearly answer the question of What a CSA is, and what they do, and even covers industry-specific *(such as Healthcare or Utilities)*.**\\n\\n## Educational Pathways\\n\\nFor this section, we will examine the various educational paths and certifications available for aspiring CSAs by answering the following question:\\n\\n> Question: Are the educational recommendations practical and accessible? Does the book cover a range of certifications?\\n\\n![Cloud Architect](Cloud_Architect_MSDesigner.jpeg)\\n\\n**I alluded to this in the previous section (Role overview); the book authors have included a list of relevant certifications for each CSA (Cloud Solution Architect) function, ie AWS Certified Machine Learning, AI Engineer Associate, for AI/ML CSAs (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Cloud Solution Architects), including a draft of fundamentals certifications across multiple platforms. It is my opinion, that the book covers educational pathways pretty well, with a vendor-neutral focus, from technical certification recommendations to even soft-skills and growth-mindset recommended reading, some great content and pathways to get started on your journey as a Cloud Solution Architect.**\\n\\n## Real-World Application\\n\\nIn this section, we will evaluate the book\'s practical advice for gaining experience and industry-specific knowledge - outside of the book.\\n\\nWe will consider how the book addresses gaining real experience through side projects, open-source contributions, and hackathons.\\n\\n![Cloud Architect](Cloud_Architect_MSDesigner1.jpeg)\\n\\n> Question: Does the book offer actionable advice for gaining experience? Are the examples and suggestions relevant to current industry standards?\\n\\n**When looking at a role, such as a Cloud Solution Architect, gaining experience is key, and the book does a good job of outlining the various ways to gain experience, from side projects, to open source contributions, to hackathons, and even to the importance of networking, and building relationships with other professionals in the industry, and the importance of mentorship, and how to find a mentor.**\\n**As a community advocate and someone who has learned by helping the community *(outside of my day-to-day role)*, by contributing to open-source projects, Microsoft Learn documentation editing and writing, and helping on Microsoft Q&A etc., public speaking, etc. - the guidance this book offers is key and even touches on the high-level roadmap of, being a consumer of an open-source project and moving to more of a Contributor role. The path to a Cloud Solution Architect is not always a straight line, and the book does a good job of outlining this: the importance of gaining experience and the various ways to do so, which are not necessarily your traditional, become an engineer, then either go into architecture or management.**\\n\\nTo quote from the book itself:\\n\\n> \\"In 1975, Steve Wozniak started working on a side project to design a general-purpose computing device suitable for hobbyist use. This device became the Apple I and helped start Apple Computer down the path toward becoming a household name. In May 2023, Apple announced a revenue of $94.8 billion for the second quarter of 2023.\\"\\n\\n## Job Pursuit Strategy\\n\\nIn this section, we will review the guidance provided for pursuing a job, crafting a resume, and preparing for interviews.\\n\\n> Question: Is the job pursuit advice up-to-date and industry-specific? How helpful are the resume and interview tips?\\n\\nNow that the book has covered alot of theory about what a CSA (Cloud Solution Architect) is and how to get experience and education *(in my opinion, covered successfully)*, now lets see how whether the guidance can help us with the next step, of preparing for interviews, and crafting a resume.\\n\\n![Cloud Architect](Cloud_Architect_MSDesigner2.jpeg)\\n\\nFirst, we need to keep in mind that this book came out in March 2024, around the same time as this review. So, the information on hand is relevant and up-to-date at the time of this review, and the job pursuit advice is relevant for the current job market. However, different industries, companies, and geographical locations may have different requirements for an Architect, so make sure to read the fine print of that role.\\n\\n**Going back to the book - the book has already touched on a Cloud Solution Architect, what that is, and how to get experience and industry-specific concerns, but what the book hasn\'t touched on YET - is the different levels, for example, Junior, Senior, Principal Cloud Solution Architect, I question I had before reading this book was:**\\n\\n**What was the difference between a Senior Cloud Solution Architect and a Principal Architect? This book answered that.**\\n\\n**The book also covered, average salary *(again company, geographical specific)*,  and recommendations on resume tips and skills. These sections were very high-level but straight to the point - the authors allowed room for you to adjust and make their recommendations your own and adjustable for the actual role you are applying for. I took the recommendations as a way to structure the sentences and my achievements on my resume, and skills (both technical and soft skills) that I may need or didn\'t think to add.**\\n\\n**Alongside the resume tips are tips about leveraging Social Media and also some relevant interview questions.**\\n\\n## Author\'s Expertise\\n\\nI believe the authors have the correct expertise to make this book viable *(and based on my own knowledge, reading this book)* and accurate.\\n\\n* [Kyle Burns](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylemburns/) is a Microsoft Principal Cloud Solution Architect - concentrating on Azure App Dev.\\n* [Rick Weyenberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rickweyenberg/) is a Microsoft Principal Azure Cloud Solution Architect with an industry focus for automotive.\\n\\n**It is my opinion that this duo is indeed suited to write this type of book, and this can be seen from the actionable and valid output of the book itself.**\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n**Cloud Solution Architect\'s Career Master Plan (1st Edition) is a book containing 124 pages of actionable and useful content for those interested in what a Cloud Solution Architect is and how to start your journey to becoming one. Key traits needed, in my opinion, for a Cloud Solution Architect are a desire to learn and stay up to date with emerging technologies; this is reflected in the guidance of the book. Overall, I had no pre-conceptions when I was asked to review this book, but it was very timely for me personally, where I am in my own career, and the questions that I had.**\\n\\n**I would like to point out that this book goes beyond by dedicating a section to giving back to the Community and the importance of mentorship, networking, soft skills and a growth mindset, which are key to being a successful Cloud Solution Architect and highly recommend picking up to read. The only issue I had was that there was missing an \'s\' to an image for on-premises! My OCD kicked in! But it was a privilege to review, definitely one I will refer to!**\\n\\nIf interested, feel free to checkout another Book review I did on [Book Review Azure Architecture Explained](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/misc/Book-Review-Azure-architecture-explained/), another great book on the more technical and governance aspects of architecting solutions in Azure."},{"id":"azure/microsoft-azure-sandbox-design-considerations","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/microsoft-azure-sandbox-design-considerations","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-21-Azure-Pattern-Sandbox/index.mdx","title":"Microsoft Azure - Sandbox Design Considerations","description":"Sandbox Design Considerations for Microsoft Azure","date":"2024-03-21T04:40:28.030Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":16.325,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Microsoft Azure - Sandbox Design Considerations","metaDescription":"Sandbox design considerations for Mirosoft Azure.","date":"2024-03-21T04:40:28.030Z","tags":["Azure"],"categories":["Azure"],"authors":["Luke"],"header":{"teaser":"BlogHeading_MicrosoftAzure_SandboxDesignConsiderations.png"},"slug":"azure/microsoft-azure-sandbox-design-considerations","keywords":["azure","platform","referencearchitecture","landingzone","sandbox"],"description":"Sandbox Design Considerations for Microsoft Azure"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Book Review Cloud Solution Architects Career Master Plan","permalink":"/azure/book-review-cloud-solution-architects-career-master-plan"},"nextItem":{"title":"Tag Azure Resources with Owner using Azure Automation","permalink":"/azure/tag-azure-resources-owner-azure-automation-runbook"}},"content":"When working with Microsoft Azure, you may want an environment for learning, whether for an individual or a team. This article aims to highlight some architectural considerations when implementing a Sandbox environment within the Microsoft Azure platform.\\n\\n:::tip\\nYour Sandbox isn\u2019t a pathway to production; it\u2019s a pathway to \u201cCLICK, CLICK, OOPS.\u201d\\n:::\\n\\n![Microsoft Azure - Sandbox Design Considerations](BlogHeading_MicrosoftAzure_SandboxDesignConsiderations.png)\\n\\n{/*truncate*/}\\n\\n## \u2601\ufe0f What is a Cloud Sandbox environment?\\n\\nWhat am I talking about when talking about a Sandbox environment?\\n\\n:::info\\nCloud Sandboxes are contained, isolated environments that allow the evaluation of new Cloud services and features _(without impacting production environments)_.\\n\\n* Sandbox is a pathway to learning, not to development\\n* Build and experiment with capabilities with an open platform\\n* Co-innovate with trust and safeguards\\n\\nThe general principles for a Sandbox environment are:\\n\\n* Cannot store Production data\\n* Secure identity with production controls\\n* Environment for learning, not production\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## \u2754Why would I want a Sandbox environment?\\n\\nHaving an environment for learning is key to driving the adoption of Cloud technologies by giving consumers the ability to leverage and test Azure resources in an isolated environment from Production; users using the Sandbox could be users new to Microsoft Azure or those who may already have Azure knowledge but want to trial and test preview features, that may not be compliant with Production controls.\\n\\n![Gartner Top 10 - Strategic Technology Trends for 2024](Gartner_Top_10_StrategicTechTrends_2024.png)\\n\\n:::info\\nPlatform Engineering is the discipline of building and operating self-service internal platforms \u2014 each platform is a layer created and maintained by a dedicated product team, designed to support the needs of its users by interfacing with tools and processes.\\n:::\\n\\nAccording to the Gartner Top 10 technology trends for 2024, Platform Engineering is a key element to enabling developers and application teams to remain competitive, not only from a business standpoint but also from talent retention, empowering employees to do more, the premise of Platform Engineering is for a \'Platform Team\' to manage the governance of the Cloud platforms _(following key well-architected framework guidelines, such as Operational Excellence, Security, Performance and Reliability)_ and also allowing the Application owners to deploy and manage their applications, without having to worry about the necessary organisational guardrails.\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude37What are the antipatterns to avoid?\\n\\nThe word \'anti-patterns\' can be quite negative terminology to use. However, it\'s really a trade-off between having an environment protected, i.e., with regulatory requirements, etc., like you would in Production, which in most cases prevents your Sandbox consumers from being able to learn without running into the various guardrails and having an environment on the opposite end of the scale, where there are no guardrails in place.\\n\\nWhen we look at anti-patterns, we need to remember what we are trying to achieve with the Cloud Sandboxes, i.e. give Sandbox consumers an environment for learning Cloud technologies.\\n\\nSo, let us take a look at some patterns and areas to avoid.\\n\\n* Regional restrictions - the reason why you might want to restrict Regional Restrictions is due to the fact that not all Azure services are available in all regions.\\n* Over extensive blocklists\\n* Trying to build the entire platform at once\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccbSandbox Patterns\\n\\nOk, let\'s talk Patterns! Every organisation may have a different Sandbox requirement, but before we discuss the particular of patterns, let\'s first talk about Platform Landing Zones at a high level so I can make sure we are all talking the same language.\\n\\nIn the context of Platform Landing Zones, I am referring to an Azure environment setup like the Enterprise Scale Landing Zone Reference architecture (ESLZ), where the Landing Zone features common components for the Platform, such as Security and Connectivity, and is usually the base of your networking infrastructure, such as Virtual WAN (Wide Area Network) connecting to your on-premises environment or a Virtual Network connecting different Applications and dependencies together.\\n\\nThe Platform Landing Zone design aims to keep Platform management consistent, centralised, and secure, allowing your application teams to leverage the shared services supplied by the Platform Landing Zone design. An organisation may have requirements to move from this reference pattern - and that is ok - but the premise here is that the Platform Landing Zone is looked after by a Platform or Infrastructure team _(in most cases)_ and the environment is architected in a way that does not impede application teams, to deliver business value, while making sure that their solutions are secure and where necessary, consistent.\\n\\n![Azure Landing Zone - Sandbox - Reference Architecture](Azure_Landing_Zone-Sandbox-ReferenceArchitecture.png)\\n\\nA sandbox usually contains:\\n\\n* Data isolation\\n* Network security (segregated)\\n* Identity and access controls\\n* Compliance and regulatory considerations\\n\\nSo, let us discuss Sandbox Types.\\n\\n![Azure Sandbox Types](Azure_Sandbox_Types.png)\\n\\n![Azure Sandbox Types](Azure_Sandbox_Types2.png)\\n\\nThe term: Managed, below - is in the context of the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework, where the environment is managed by the organisation and is part of the organisation\'s governance, identity and compliance controls, and Platform team managed.\\n\\n### Sandbox Type - Personal\\n\\nWhen referring to a Personal Sandbox, I am referring to a Free, Pay As You Go, or Azure Sponsorship, [Visual Studio Enterprise subscription(s)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) that are used by an individual, an example is a Cloud Engineer, who has access to a Visual Studio Enterprise subscription and then uses the free credit, to spin up an Azure subscription - that is unmanaged and not part of the organisation\'s network, identity or compliance controls. These subscriptions usually have a hard limit on the type of resources you can deploy or Budget.\\n\\nPersonal subscriptions are outside of the organisation\'s control and are not managed by the organisation. They are usually used for learning and not for production workloads. For individuals with these licenses, these subscriptions can be key to preparing for certification or individual upskilling.\\n\\n### Sandbox Type - Unmanaged\\n\\nWhen I refer to an Unmanaged Sandbox, I am referring to an Azure subscription that is managed by the organisation but is not part of the organisation\'s network, identity, or production compliance controls (although it would be auditable). \\nThese subscriptions are usually used for learning, not for production workloads. For individuals or teams, these subscriptions can be key to preparing for certification or team upskilling with Cloud technologies and preview features.\\n\\n### Sandbox Type - Lightly Managed\\n\\nWhen referring to Lightly Managed Sandboxes, these are more managed than an Unmanaged subscription because they are Resource Group limited; for example, a team of 10 may have access to a Lightly Managed Sandbox, where they can deploy resources into a specific Resource Group, or Resource Groups that they have access to, however, the overall governance of the Subscription is done by the Platform team. This is useful when you have a lot of individuals wanting a specific regulated Resource Group to stand up resources into, vs giving them a Subscription each.\\n\\nResource Group tags can be key to [FinOps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/fasttrack-for-azure/the-azure-finops-guide/ba-p/3704132?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) cost management and tracking.\\n\\nLightly Managed sandboxes can be useful for smaller organisations that do not want Subscription sprawl.\\n\\n### Sandbox Type - Highly Managed\\n\\nHighly Managed Sandboxes are usually used for testing the same set of services repeatedly, where the users (particularly Developers) don\'t necessarily care about the underly Azure platform and resources and are more focussed on the application and services they are deploying, for example, a developer may want to test a new version of a service, and they can deploy the service into a Highly Managed Sandbox, and then run their tests, and then destroy the environment. \\nHighly Managed Sandboxes are useful for standing up consistant infrastructure, such as an Azure Kubernetes Service or App Service, that is used every single time.\\n\\n\\n:::info\\nThe main difference is that managed sandboxes have pre-determined services that can be deployed as needed, which is useful for testing the same set of services repeatedly.\\nLightly managed sandboxes are useful when many individuals want a specific regulated Resource Group to allocate resources to.\\n\\nIn contrast, the unmanaged sandbox is more open and less restrictive, which makes it ideal for learning and trying new technologies for a small to large team.\\n:::\\n\\n### Sandbox Type decisions\\n\\nWhen deciding on the type of Sandbox, you need to consider the following:\\n\\n* **The purpose of the Sandbox**. What are you trying to achieve with the Sandbox? Are you trying to give users an environment to learn, or are you trying to give users an environment to test a specific set of services?\\n* **The scope of the Sandbox**. Are you trying to give users an environment to learn, or are you trying to give users an environment to test a specific set of services?\\n* **The lifecycle of the Sandbox**. How long do you want it to be available? Do you want it to be available for a specific period of time?\\n* **The Cost of the Sandbox**. How much are you willing to spend on it? Who has the financial authority to approve Cloud spending?\\n* **Access to the Sandbox**. Who has access to the Sandbox, and how do you manage access to the Sandbox?\\n* **Management of the Sandbox**. Who is responsible for managing the Sandbox? How do you manage the lifecycle of the Sandbox?\\n* **Governance of the Sandbox**. How do you manage the governance of the Sandbox? How do you manage the compliance of the Sandbox? \\n* **Migration of the Sandbox**. How do you migrate the Sandbox to a different environment? How do you migrate the Sandbox to a different subscription? ie what would migration of a proof of technology from a Sandbox environment into Dev/Test or Production look like?\\n* **Security of the Sandbox**. How do you manage the security of the Sandbox? How do you manage the identity and access to a Sandbox? How do you manage the compliance of the Sandbox?\\n* **Monitoring of the Sandbox** How do you monitor the Sandbox? How do you manage the cost of the Sandbox? How do you manage the performance of resources in the Sandbox (and do you need to)?\\n* **Integration of the Sandbox**. How do you integrate the Sandbox with other environments? How do you integrate the Sandbox with other subscriptions? How do you integrate the Sandbox with other services?\\n\\nConsideration of all of the above will help you decide on the type of Sandbox that is right for your organisation.\\n\\n![Azure Sandbox Decisions](Azure_Sandbox_TypeDecisions.png)\\n\\n| Criteria | Personal | Unmanaged | Lightly Managed | Highly Managed |\\n|----------|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|\\n| Purpose | Learning, individual upskilling | Learning, team upskilling | Regulated resource group for team | Testing specific services repeatedly |\\n| Scope | Individual | Small to large team | Specific team | Specific services |\\n| Lifecycle | Determined by individual | Determined by team | Managed by platform team | Managed by platform team |\\n| Cost | Limited by subscription type | Auditable, managed by organisation | Managed by platform team | Managed by platform team |\\n| Access | Individual | Team | Regulated by platform team | Regulated by platform team |\\n| Management | Individual | Team | Platform team | Platform team |\\n| Governance | Individual | Auditable, managed by organisation | Managed by platform team | Managed by platform team |\\n| Migration | Individual responsibility | Team responsibility | Managed by platform team | Managed by platform team |\\n| Security | Individual responsibility | Auditable, managed by organisation | Managed by platform team | Managed by platform team |\\n| Monitoring | Individual responsibility | Team responsibility | Managed by platform team | Managed by platform team |\\n| Integration | Individual responsibility | Team responsibility | Managed by platform team | Managed by platform team |\\n\\n\\nLet\'s look at a scenario:\\n\\nWe have a Data Scientist named Samuel.\\n\\n![Samuel - Data Scientist](Azure_Sandbox_Scenario_Samuel.png)\\n\\nSamuel\'s goals are to:\\n\\n1. **Deliver high-quality and robust machine learning solutions that can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty**x, as well as increase the revenue and profitability of the company. \\n2. **Learn the latest and most advanced techniques and methods in the field of artificial intelligence, such as natural language processing**, computer vision, and deep learning, to create innovative and cutting-edge models.\\n3. To **collaborate and learn from other data scientists and experts in the field, both within and outside his company**, to improve his knowledge.\\n4. **Self-management and accountability of cost management** and access to the environment for Data/AI projects across multiple responsible team members**.\\n\\nIf we also take a look at the [Microsoft AI Shared responsibility model](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility-ai?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), we can see that the Data Scientist, is responsible for the Data, the AI model, and the AI application, and the Platform team is responsible for the underlying infrastructure, and the AI platform.\\n\\n![Microsoft AI Shared Responsibility Model](Azure_Sandbox_Scenario_Samuel_AI_SharedResponsibility.png)\\n\\nBecause of Samuel\'s requirements and the shared responsibility model, we can see that Samuel would benefit from an Unmanaged Sandbox, where he can deploy resources into a specific Subscription he has access to, alongside members of his team and approved external identities, while also being isolated from Production. He has also accepted responsibility for Cost.\\n\\nThe reference architecture of Samuel\'s Sandbox could look like the following:\\n\\n![Azure Sandbox - Reference Architecture - Samuel](Sandbox_Reference_Architecture.png)\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude99Pathway to Production\\n\\n:::info\\nRemember: The Sandbox is not a pathway to production; it is a pathway to \\"CLICK, CLICK, OOPS\\".\\n:::\\n\\n**However**, there will be times when users have learnt something in the Sandbox, and they want to move their solution into a Dev/Test or Production environment, and this is where the [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) comes into play, and the [Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/well-architected/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) can be used to help guide the migration of the solution from the Sandbox into a Dev/Test or Production environment.\\n\\nMake sure to consider the following:\\n\\n1. **Identify and document the requirements and specifications of the product after your learning**: After experimenting and learning in the Sandbox, it\'s crucial to identify and document the requirements and specifications of the product. This includes understanding the technical requirements, the business needs, and the user expectations. This step is in line with the Strategy phase of the Cloud Adoption Framework.\\n2. **Security considerations (RBAC, Access, CISO review)**: Security is a paramount concern when moving from a Sandbox to a Production environment. Considerations should include Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized individuals have access, a thorough review of access permissions, and a review by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or equivalent. This aligns with the Well-Architected Framework\'s security pillar.\\n3. **Ensure that the data, code, models, and outputs are suitable for Production; change**: Before moving to Production, ensure that all data, code, models, and outputs are production-ready. This means they should be thoroughly tested, reliable, and meet all necessary regulations and standards. This is part of the Plan and Ready phases of the Cloud Adoption Framework.\\n4. **Deploy the production using CI/CD where possible**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a best practice for deploying applications. It allows for frequent code changes, automated testing, and quick deployment to production. This is part of the Migrate and Innovate phases of the Cloud Adoption Framework.\\n5. **Test and debug**: Rigorous testing and debugging are essential to ensure the product works as expected and any issues are identified and fixed before going live. This aligns with the Well-Architected Framework\'s reliability pillar.\\n6. **Monitor and manage**: Once in production, the application should be continuously monitored and managed to ensure it remains secure, performs well, and meets user needs. This includes monitoring for any issues, managing updates and changes, and regularly reviewing performance. This is part of the Govern and Manage phases of the Cloud Adoption Framework.\\n\\nAlso, make sure you make sure of Cloud Adoption Framework Landing Zone guidance, such as [Dev/Test Management Group and subscription Landing Zone guidance, such as a Canary Management Group structure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/testing-approach?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\nAlthough not mandatory, the canary environment management group hierarchy can be used to simplify testing of the following resource types without ending up with a range of exemptions and overprivileged access to Production resources, where it is not required:\\n\\n* **Management groups**: Management groups in Azure provide a level of scope above subscriptions. They give you enterprise-grade management at a large scale no matter what type of subscriptions you might have. All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied at the management group level.\\n* **Subscription placement**: The placement of subscriptions within the management group hierarchy is crucial. It allows for the application of governance conditions at different levels, providing flexibility and control over the environment.\\n* **Roles (built-in and custom)**: Azure provides several built-in roles that you can assign to users, groups, and services. You can also create custom roles if the built-in roles don\'t meet your specific needs.\\n* **Assignments**: Assignments in Azure RBAC are the links between roles and security principals (user, group, service principal, or managed identity). They define the access a security principal has.\\n* **Azure Policy**: Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies enforce different rules and effects over your resources, helping to ensure your resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements.\\n* **Definitions (built-in and custom)**: Azure Policy uses policy definitions to express what to evaluate and what action to take. There are built-in definitions provided by Azure and you can also create custom definitions.\\n* **Initiatives, also known as set definitions**: An initiative definition is a set or group of policy definitions to help track your compliance state for a larger goal. Initiatives bring together one or more policies as a group to accomplish things like enabling real-time policy enforcement and more comprehensive coverage.\\n\\nThe Canary Landing Zone architecture is useful as it provides a controlled environment for testing changes and updates before they are applied to the production resources.\\n\\n![Azure Landing Zones - Canary](canary-mgmt-groups.png)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udea2Products and tools\\n\\nWhen considering a Sandbox environment, you may want to consider the following products and tools to assist.\\n\\n* [Azure Deployment Environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/deployment-environments/overview-what-is-azure-deployment-environments?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) - useful for \'Highly Managed Sandboxes\', Azure Deployment Environments, allows you to pre-define a set of services through infrastructure as code, and offer it up to developers or Sandbox consumers, as a Service, that they can then deploy and tear down as required.\\n* [Azure Dev/Test Labs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) - Azure DevTest Labs is a service for easily creating, using, and managing infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) virtual machines (VMs) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) environments in labs. Labs offer preconfigured bases and artifacts for creating VMs, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates for creating environments like Azure Web Apps or SharePoint farms. Azure DevTest Labs is useful for Lightly Managed Sandboxes, where you want to give a team access to a specific Resource Group.\\n* [Entra ID Access Packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) - Access packages are great for giving delegated access to a specific set of resources, for a specific period of time, and can be useful for Lightly and Unmanaged  Sandboxes, where you want to give a team access to a specific Resource Group or Subscription.\\n* [Microsoft Purview](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/purview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) - Microsoft Purview is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, multi-cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data.

I wanted to see if I could do the same thing using Azure Automation runbooks, instead of using event grid but a schedule instead, to make use of an already existing [Azure Automation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/automation/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) account.\\n\\nIt turns out you can, so let\'s take a look.\\n\\n![Blog Heading - Tag Azure Resources with Owner using Azure Automation runbook](BlogHeading_TagAzureResourceswithOwnerAzureAutomation.png)\\n\\n{/*truncate*/}\\n\\nMake sure to change the ManagementGroupID variable to match your own environment.\\n\\nThis runbook uses a System Managed Identity from the Azure Automation account, so make sure this has Contributor rights to the subscription or management group you want to tag resources in. \\n\\n:::info\\nThis PowerShell script is designed to tag Azure resources with the user\'s email address who last modified them. It\'s particularly useful for tracking who is responsible for each resource in your Azure environment. Here\'s a step-by-step breakdown of what the script does:\\n1. **Disable AzContext Autosave**: The script starts by disabling the autosave feature for the Azure context. This ensures the script doesn\'t inherit any Azure context from previous sessions.\\n2. **Suppress Warnings**: The script suppresses warnings related to breaking changes in Azure PowerShell. This is to prevent these warnings from cluttering the output.\\n3. **Import Modules**: The script imports the Az.Accounts and Az.Resources modules, which provide the cmdlets needed to interact with Azure.\\n4. **Define Variables**: The script defines a variable for the tag name (`$tagName`) and the management group ID (`$ManagementGroupID`).\\n5. **Connect to Azure**: The script uses a Managed Service Identity.\\n6. **Get Subscriptions**: The script defines a function (`Get-AzSubscriptionsFromManagementGroup`) that retrieves all the subscription IDs under a specified management group, including subscriptions under child management groups. It then calls this function to get the subscription IDs under the management group specified by `$ManagementGroupID`.\\n7. **Process Each Subscription**: For each subscription ID retrieved, the script sets the Azure context to that subscription and retrieves all resources in the subscription.\\n8. **Process Each Resource**: For each resource in the subscription, the script checks if the resource has a tag with the name specified by `$tagName`.\\n9. **Add Tag If Not Present**: If the resource does not have a tag with the name specified by `$tagName`, the script retrieves the Azure activity logs for the resource for the past seven days and finds the user\'s email address who last modified the resource. It then adds a tag to the resource with the name specified by `$tagName` and the value set to the user\'s email address.\\nThis script is designed to be run on a schedule, such as once a day, to ensure that all resources are tagged with the user\'s email address who last modified them.\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD\\n  A[Start] --\x3e B[Disable AzContext Autosave]\\n  B --\x3e C[Suppress Warnings]\\n  C --\x3e D[Import Modules]\\n  D --\x3e E[Define Variables]\\n  E --\x3e F[Connect to Azure]\\n  F --\x3e G[Get Subscriptions]\\n  G --\x3e H{For Each Subscription}\\n  H --\x3e I[Set Azure Context]\\n  I --\x3e J[Get All Resources]\\n  J --\x3e K{For Each Resource}\\n  K --\x3e L[Check If Tag Exists]\\n  L --\x3e |No|M[Get Azure Activity Logs]\\n  M --\x3e N[Find Last Modified User]\\n  N --\x3e O[Add Tag]\\n  O --\x3e P[End]\\n  L --\x3e |Yes|P\\n  K --\x3e H\\n  ```\\n:::\\n\\n![Tag Azure Resources with Owner](Tag_Owner-RunbookRun.gif)\\n\\nThe Runbook is as follows:\\n\\n```powershell\\n<# Ensures you do not inherit an AzContext in your runbook #>\\nDisable-AzContextAutosave -Scope Process | Out-Null;\\n\\n#Toggle to stop warnings with regard to Breaking Changes in Azure PowerShell\\nSet-Item -Path Env:\\\\SuppressAzurePowerShellBreakingChangeWarnings -Value $true\\n\\n# Import the required modules\\nImport-Module Az.Accounts\\nImport-Module Az.Resources\\n\\n# Define the tag name as a variable\\n$tagName = \\"Createdby\\"\\n\\n#Adjust to suit your management group; this is the top scope that the Script will run under\\n$ManagementGroupID = \'mg-landingzones\'\\n\\n\\n<# Connect using a Managed Service Identity #>\\n\\nConnect-AzAccount -Identity\\n\\n\\n\\n# Get the subscription IDs under the specified management group AND child management groups\\nfunction Get-AzSubscriptionsFromManagementGroup {\\n    param($ManagementGroupName)\\n    $mg = Get-AzManagementGroup -GroupId $ManagementGroupName -Expand\\n    foreach ($child in $mg.Children) {\\n        if ($child.Type -match \'/managementGroups$\') {\\n            Get-AzSubscriptionsFromManagementGroup -ManagementGroupName $child.Name\\n        }\\n        else {\\n            $child | Select-Object @{N = \'Name\'; E = { $_.DisplayName } }, @{N = \'Id\'; E = { $_.Name } }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n\\nWrite-Output \\"Setting ManagementGroupID to $($mgid.DisplayName)\'...\\"\\n\\nWrite-Output \\"Retrieving management group with ID \'$ManagementGroupID\'...\\"\\n$mgid = Get-AzManagementGroup -GroupId $ManagementGroupID -Expand\\n\\nWrite-Output \\"Successfully retrieved management group with ID \'$ManagementGroupID\'.\\"\\n\\nWrite-Output \\"Retrieving subscription IDs from management group \'$($mgid.DisplayName)\'...\\"\\n\\n$subIds = Get-AzSubscriptionsFromManagementGroup -ManagementGroupName $ManagementGroupID \\n\\nforeach ($subId in $subIds) {\\n    Write-Output \\"Setting subscription context for subscription $subId...\\"\\n    Set-AzContext -Subscription $subId.Id\\n\\n    $resources = Get-AzResource \\n\\n    Write-Output \\"Found resources in subscription $subId.\\"\\n\\n    foreach ($resource in $resources) {\\n        Write-Output \\"Processing resource $($resource.Name)...\\"\\n        $tags = $resource.Tags\\n        if ($null -eq $tags -or -not $tags.ContainsKey($tagName)) {        \\n            Write-Output \\"Resource $($resource.Name) does not have \'resource-owner\' and  tags.

This is a great way to ensure that your Azure environment complies with your company\'s policies and standards, so let us look at it!\\n\\n![Blog Heading - EPAC ADO](BlogHeading_EPAC_ADO.png)\\n\\n{/*truncate*/}\\n\\n[Enterprise Azure Policy as Code (EPAC)](https://azure.github.io/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/) allows you to define and deploy your Azure policies and exemptions as code. This is a great way to ensure consistency of one or more Azure environments, including managing your exemptions in a way that is auditable and a way that can be integrated into CI/CD pull request approval processes.\\n\\nSo, let\'s delve a little further into it.\\n\\n## What is Enterprise Azure Policy as Code?\\n\\n:::info\\nEnterprise Azure Policy as Code, or EPAC for short, comprises a number of scripts which can be used in a CI/CD-based system or a semi-automated use to deploy Policies, Policy Sets, Assignments, Policy Exceptions and Role Assignments.\\n\\nMain features include:\\n\\n* Multi-tenant/environment policy deployment\\n* Easy CI/CD Integration\\n* Extract existing policy objects from an environment\\n* Support JSON and CSV inputs for large, complex policies\\n* PowerShell Module\\n* Integration with Azure Landing Zone recommended policies\\n* Starter Kit with examples\\n* Schema to provide Intellisense for VS Code development\\n:::\\n\\nEnterprise Policy as Code, runs primarily on PowerShell scripts, at the time of writing, there is 114 PowerShell scripts that make up this solution *(not all are in use for day-to-day operations)*, from the actual deployment to the plan, importing existing policies and initiatives, creating GitHub or Azure DevOps issues, for policy remediation tasks and even importing Azure Landing Zone policies into the solution, this solution is jam-packed with an ever-expanding toolset.\\n\\n:::tip\\nIt is worth noting that although this solution was designed and implemented by Microsoft employees, this is an [Open Source initiative](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/) and is not officially supported by Microsoft, but the community is very active, and the solution is constantly being updated and improved upon. All [Issues](https://github.com/Azure/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/issues) can be raised directly on GitHub, and if you have any queries, concerns or issues, I suggest you look here first.\\n:::\\n\\n## Why would you use Enterprise Azure Policy as Code?\\n\\nSo, why would you use EPAC? Before we go into that - let\'s go back to basics - Azure Policy.\\n\\n![What is Azure Policy](WhatIsAzurePolicy.png)\\n\\n[Azure policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) are essential to Azure governance; they are the \'make it so\' of the Azure environment *(and beyond)*.\\n\\nThe policies exist to help across areas such as:\\n\\n* Maintain regulatory compliance with industry standards\\n* Security and performance consistencies\\n* Enterprise-wide design principles\\n* Controlling cost\\n\\nBut how do they do that? Let us take a look at the definitions that make them sing!\\n\\nFor this, we are to look at some of the key components of a definition for the \'Function apps should authenticate to Azure Container Registry using a managed identity\' policy.\\n\\n![Azure Policy definition](PolicyDefinition.png)\\n\\n* Metadata\\n* Parameters\\n* Rules\\n\\nMetadata includes items such as: DisplayName, Mode *(Indexed vs All)*, version and categories. \\nParameters give you the flexibility to adjust your policy to your environment, in this case, the policy is looking for a specific Azure Container Registry, but you could have a parameter for the resource group, the subscription, or even the identity that it uses, which can be adjusted to be unique between environments.\\nRules are the actual policy; in this case, the policy is looking for a specific identity to be used to authenticate to the Azure Container Registry but will contain the type of resources that the policy will affect, the aliases or resource properties that it needs to look for to evaluate against, and even change.\\n\\nSo, why would you use EPAC? Imagine you have a large number of policies, a large number of environments, or even a large number of policy exemptions, managing your policies as code is a great way to manage them all in a consistent and auditable way, especially when you are working with different versions of policies, and policies deployed to different scopes as well.\\n\\n![Azure Policy Scopes](EnterprisePolicyAsCode_PolicyAssignmentScope.png)\\n\\n## How do you use Enterprise Azure Policy as Code?\\n\\nNow that we have looked into some of the complexity of Azure policies, especially at scale. Let us take a look into how we can get going with [Enterprise Policy as Code](https://azure.github.io/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/).\\n\\nIn this article, I am going to assume a few things:\\n\\n1. You have permission to deploy policies and policy assignments in your Azure environment\\n2. You have an Azure DevOps environment (we will use Azure DevOps pipelines in this article, however there is also GitHub action workflows that can be used if you are using GitHub as well) and [Service Connection configured](https://azure.github.io/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/ci-cd-app-registrations/).\\n\\nWe are going to leverage the EPAC [StarterKit](https://github.com/Azure/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/tree/main/StarterKit), for the pipelines and scripts.\\n\\nBefore we get CI/CD pipelines set up, we need to do a few things locally first.\\n\\n### Step 1: Import existing policies\\n\\nSo, let\'s import our existing policies and set up our environment! I highly recommend importing your existing environment first, as this will give you a good starting point for your policies, policy sets and exemptions.\\n\\n:::info\\nThis requires a computer running: [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) 7.3.1 or later, 7.3.4 *(latest)* recommended, and the [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell?view=azps-11.3.0&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) module installed (Az required 9.3.0 or later).\\n:::\\n\\nIn my environment, I have a range of Custom and Builtin policies and initiatives, that are mostly deployed to at the top level, including Sandbox policies, and am I also running an NZISM 3.5 initiative, which is a builtin iniative but not the most up-to-date, so as part of the EPAC implementation, I want to replace the policy assignment with 3.6 custom and assign my Sandbox policies to the Sandbox Management Group.\\n\\nSo let us get cracking!\\n\\n1. First, we need to install the EPAC PowerShell module and the Az module and connect to our Azure environment.\\n\\n```powershell\\n    Install-Module EnterprisePolicyAsCode -Scope CurrentUser\\n    Install-Module Az -Scope CurrentUser\\n    Connect-AzAccount\\n```\\n![Install PowerShell modules](EPAC_InstallPowerShellModules.gif)\\n\\n2. Once that\'s installed and you are connected to the Azure environment that you want to export your policies from, now we can do the export. To do the export, you have to generate a BuildDefinition folder to contain your policies, assignments and exemptions.\\n\\n\\n```powershell\\n    New-EPACDefinitionFolder -DefinitionsRootFolder Definitions\\n```\\n\\n![Create Definitions folder](EPAC_CreateDefinitionsFolder.gif)\\n\\nThat will create the following folders and files, giving us the base scaffolding for Enterprise Policy as Code:\\n\\n| Folder & Files        | Type   | Notes                                                                      |\\n| --------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| policyAssignments     | Folder | Contains your Assignments (for both Policy and Initiatives)                |\\n| policyDefinitions     | Folder | Contains your Policy Definitions                                           |\\n| policyDocumentations  | Folder | Contains documentation about your policies                                 |\\n| policySetDefinitions  | Folder | Contains the definitions for your initiatives (or PolicySets)              |\\n| global-settings.jsonc | File   | Main configuration file, containing your environments and deployment paths |\\n\\n3. Now that we have our base, scaffold - before we can import our existing Definitions and Assignments, we need to edit the \'global-settings.jsonc\' file, to add in environment context.\\n\\n:::tip\\nThe file is a JSONC file, which is a JSON file with comments, so you can add comments to the file, which is great for documentation. The same jsonc format is also used for PolicyDefinitions and assignments, allowing you to add more context and notes to your policies and assignments! I encourage you to use this functionality to add notes and comments to your assignments!\\n:::\\n\\nSo open the global-settings.jsonc file, and paste the following example:\\n\\n```jsonc\\n    {\\n        \\"$schema\\": \\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/main/Schemas/global-settings-schema.json\\",\\n        \\"pacOwnerId\\": \\"f2ce1aea-944e-4517-94fb-edada00633ae\\", // Generate a guid using New-Guid and place it here\\n        \\"managedIdentityLocations\\": {\\n            \\"*\\": \\"australiaeast\\" // Update the default location for managed identities\\n        },\\n        \\"globalNotScopes\\": {\\n            \\"*\\": [\\n                \\"/resourceGroupPatterns/excluded-rg*\\"\\n            ]\\n        },\\n        \\"pacEnvironments\\": [\\n            {\\n                \\"pacSelector\\": \\"quick-start\\",\\n                \\"cloud\\": \\"AzureCloud\\",\\n                \\"tenantId\\": \\"bdb8ea1c-17da-4423-8895-6b79af002b4e\\", // Replace this with your tenant Id\\n                \\"deploymentRootScope\\": \\"/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/root\\" // Replace this with a management group that represents the functional root in your environment. \\n            }\\n        ]\\n    }\\n```\\n\\n![Create global-settings.jsconc](EPAC_Create-global-settings.jsconc.gif)\\n\\n**Reference: [EPAC Quick Start](https://azure.github.io/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/quick-start/)**\\n\\nWe now need to define our overall environment, and we can start by using PowerShell to generate our own unique pacOwnerId.\\n\\n```powershell\\n    New-Guid\\n```\\nThe pacOwner helps to identify who or what owns an Assignment or Policy definition deployment and needs to be unique to your EPAC environment. The pacOwnerId is used to identity policy resources that are deployed by your EPAC repository, or another EPAC isntance, legacy or another solution entirely.\\n\\nAnother thing you may need to adjust is the managedIdentityLocations, this is the default location for managed identities that are used for policies that are DeployIfNotExist and Modify. This is the location that the managed identity will be created in, if it does not exist. I will keep this as the example, AustraliaEast which is the primary region that my resources are deployed into.\\n\\nIf you run multiple regions, you can remove the wildcard and replace it with the pacEnvironments name that represents your other regions.\\n\\nAlthough you can add exclusions to your individual Policy and PolicySetAssignments, the globalNotScopes is a way to exclude resources from all Policy and PolicySetAssignments, without having to add it to every single assignment, in this case, the example excludes all resources that are in a resource group that starts with \'excluded-rg\'. You can exclude resources at different scopes, ie Resource Group, Subscriptions, Resouce Groups.\\n\\nNow, lets take a look at pacEnvironments. pacEnvironments is a way to define your environments, and the deploymentRootScope is the scope that represents the functional root in your environment. This is the top scope that all your Policy and PolicySetAssignments will be deployed to, and is the scope that you will be deploying your policies definitions to.\\n\\nThe pacSelector will be used in your assignments to select what environment and scope you are deploying to, as you can have multiple environments, so give it a name that you can understand - ie \'epac-prod\', \'epac-dev\', \'epac-qa\' etc. This will be reused in your assignments and pipelines.\\n\\nMake sure the tenantId matches your Entra ID and the deploymentRootScope is the top-level scope that you want to deploy your policies to.\\n\\nSave the file.\\n\\n4. The next step is to import your existing policies and assignments, the commands will use the information you just defined in the \'global-settings.jsonc\' file, to review of the scope and the environment of the export.\\n\\nTo do that, we will go back to PowerShell:\\n\\n  ```powershell\\n    Export-AzPolicyResources -DefinitionsRootFolder .\\\\Definitions -OutputFolder Output\\n  ```\\n\\n![Export-AzPolicyResources.gif](Export-AzPolicyResources.gif)\\n\\n:::tip\\nIf you want to target a specific environment, ie you have a Management Group, where you want to deploy your policies and test using the Azure Portal first **(this can be useful for quickly importing assignments and policies in a format that\'s ready to go by EPAC)**, then you can add the \'-InputPacSelector\' parameter and target a specific environment for export, else it will do all environments listed in the global-settings.\\n:::\\n\\nDepending on the complexity of your environment, it could take a while, but once it is done, you will have a new folder called \'Output\', which will contain an export of your policy-ownerships, definitions, assignments and exemptions in an Enterprise Policy as Code useable format *(JSON)*.\\n\\nYour Output folder will contain the policy exemptions, assignments, and definitions of your existing environment.\\n\\nYou can copy the files and folders from the Output folder, into the original Definitions folder, originally created, to bring in your existing policies and assignments into your EPAC environment.\\n\\n:::tip\\nNow is a great time to look at those exemptions and policy assignments and see if they are still relevant, and if they are, add comments to the files to give context to the assignments and exemptions and to help with the deployment of the policies and assignments in the future.\\n:::\\n\\n### Step 2: Configure Azure DevOps\\n\\nNow that we have our policies and assignments imported, we can now configure our Azure DevOps environment, to automatically deploy them. I am going to go through the process from the beginning but feel free to skip to the relevant sections if you already have a project and repository setup.\\n\\n1. Login to Azure DevOps\\n2. Create a new project\\n3. Give the project a name, and a description, and select the visibility of the project **(ie Private)**\\n4. Click \'Create\'\\n5. Navigate to Repos\\n6. Click on Files\\n6. Initialize the repository with a README or add a new file\\n\\n![Create EPAC ADO Project](Create-ADO_EPACProject.gif)\\n\\nNow that the repository has been initialized. We can now add the files from the EPAC StarterKit to the repository.\\n\\nClone the repository to your local computer copy the Definitions folder to the repository and commit. \\n\\n:::info\\nYou can Clone the Git repository using [Visual Studio Code](https://azuredevopslabs.com/labs/azuredevops/git/?T.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), or Git CLI or even [GitHub Desktop](https://luke.geek.nz/2021/12/30/git-using-github-desktop-on-windows-for-sysadmins/).\\n:::\\n\\nOnce cloned, copy the Definitions folder from the Output folder, into the repository, and commit the changes.\\n\\nNow that we have our repository setup, we can now create a pipeline to deploy our policies and assignments, to get started we will grab the Azure Pipelines from the [StarterKit](https://github.com/Azure/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/tree/main/StarterKit/Pipelines) folder, and copy them into the repository, along with the Scripts folder.\\n\\nFor this article, we will use the single-tenant-pipeline.yml file, as we are only deploying to a single environment, but if you are deploying to multiple environments, you can use the multi-tenant-pipeline.yml file.\\n\\n![Create ADO Pipeline](Create_ADO-PipelineTemplate.gif)\\n\\nOnce downloaded, make sure you commit it to your repository. We will have to edit the pipeline, but before we do that - we need a Service Connection for Azure DevOps to connect to Azure to deploy the policies and assignments.\\n\\n1. Open your EPAC Azure DevOps project\\n2. Click on Project Settings\\n3. Select Service Connections\\n4. Click on Create Service Connection\\n5. Click Azure Resource Manager\\n6. Click Next\\n7. Select Workload Identity Federation (Automatic) and click Next\\n8. Select Management Group\\n9.

Tenant is the default name of the EPAC environment, so we will need to change this, to reflect our own environments. This is the pacSelector name, in the global-settings.jsonc file, that we created earlier.\\n\\nI will go back and add a new Service Connection, for Development, and add another development environment to the global-settings.jsonc. You don\'t need to do this, but it does give you the option to test your policies and assignments before deploying them to your main environment.\\n\\nNow we need to edit the pipeline again, to align to our pacEnvironments.\\n\\n:::info\\nYou could do a a full Find and Replace, of the Word Tenant on the pipeline and replace it with your Production pacEnvironment name, just be wary that the stage name is used as a depedency for other steps, so you will need to make sure all references have been updated.\\n:::\\n\\nOnce you have made the changes, commit the pipeline to your repository.\\n\\n![Edit ADO Pipeline - pacEnvironment](Edit_ADO-Pipeline_pacEnvironments.gif)\\n\\nBefore we look at actually running the pipeline and redeploying the policies under Enterprise Policy as Code, we need to be aware of another environment option - and that is desiredState.\\n\\ndesiredState allows you to control, how much control EPAC has over your environment, ie how much of a \'make it so\'.\\n\\ndesiredState options are:\\n\\n* full\\n* ownedOnly\\n\\nIf the desired state strategy is \'Full\', then EPAC will manage all the policies and assignments in the environment and will remove any policies and assignments that are not in the EPAC repository.\\nIf the desiredState strategy is \'ownedOnly\', then EPAC will only manage the policies and assignments that are in the EPAC repository, and will not remove any policies and assignments that are not in the EPAC repository.\\n\\nFull is the default desiredState, so if you want to use ownedOnly, you will need to add the desiredState to the global-settings.jsonc file for the environment.\\n\\n  ```jsonc\\n // desiredState is an optional object that specifies the desired state of the environment.\\n            \\"desiredState\\": { // [optional]\\n                // strategy specifies the strategy to achieve the desired state. The default is \\"full\\".\\n                \\"ownedOnly\\": \\"full\\" // default full\\n            }\\n  ```\\n\\nAnother environment option is related to Defender for Cloud. [Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/policy-reference?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) uses Azure Policy Assignments to enable and configure the various capabilities.\\nEnterprise Policy as Code could remove the Defender for Cloud assignments if they are not in the EPAC repository, so you can add the following to the global-settings.jsonc file to prevent this from happening.\\n\\n  ```jsonc\\n   \\"desiredState\\": { // [optional]\\n                // strategy specifies the strategy to achieve the desired state. The default is \\"full\\".\\n                \\"strategy\\": \\"full\\" ,// default full\\n                \\"keepDfcSecurityAssignments\\": true // default false\\n            }\\n  ```\\n\\nIf set to true or strategy is ownedOnly, EPAC will not remove Security Policy assignments created by Defender for Cloud.\\nIf omitted or set to false and strategy is full, EPAC will remove Security Policy Set Assignments created by Defender for Cloud.\\n\\nEven though these settings are managed by the default behaviour of Enterprise Policy as Code, I prefer to make sure they are added in the configuration for awareness. Security Policies should be managed by EPAC at the Management Group level; this is the recommended approach for managing Security Policies instead of relying on the auto-assignments, but as usual, it comes down to business requirements.\\n\\n### Step 3: Run the Pipeline\\n\\n:::danger\\nMake sure you test your deployment in a development environment before deploying to your main environment, especially if you are using the \'full\' desiredState strategy.\\n:::\\n\\nNow it\'s time to import the pipeline.\\n\\n1.

Error: Client address is not authorized and caller is not a trusted service.\\n:::\\n\\nThis is due to the Firewall of the Keyvault being enabled, which is best practice.\\n\\nYou have a few options here:\\n\\n* Option 1: Enable private endpoint for the KeyVault and use a [self-hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbrowser&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#self-hosted-agents). This is the most secure option, but it requires more setup and configuration, and a self-hosted agent, running on a Virtual Machine or [Container Apps](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/hosted-agents-container-apps-job/).\\n* Option 2: Add the IP of the Azure DevOps agent to the KeyVault firewall rules. This is the easiest option, but it\'s not the most secure, as the IP address of the Microsoft hosted agents can change *(the Microsoft hosted agents have a dynamic IP address)*.\\n\\nNot all organisations have the resources to support a self-hosted agent, so we will look at Option 2.\\n\\n![Azure KeyVault - Networking Blade (Azure Portal)](Azure_KeyVault_NetworkingPane.png \\"Azure KeyVault - Networking Blade (Azure Portal)\\")\\n\\nAs a status, the Microsoft Hosted agents can come from any number of [Microsoft-owned IP addresses](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) from the region, that your Azure DevOps organisation is hosted.\\n\\nYou may immediately want to check the **Allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall** as an instant thought, but [ Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/network-security?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#key-vault-firewall-enabled-trusted-services-only) is not an assumed trusted Microsoft service, and its not hosted within your subscription boundary.\\n\\nSo, that leaves us with enabling public access to the key vault, right? Because the IP will be different each time? Not quite! What we can do is:\\n\\n1. Add the IP of the Azure DevOps agent to the KeyVault firewall rules.\\n2.

It needs to align with your organisational needs, naming conventions, projects and departments where necessary. Different resource types, will require different configurations, so make sure you plan this out, the Azure Naming Tool reference page can be key to review for successful name generation.\\n:::\\n\\nFirst, we will need the API Key, so within the Azure Naming Tool, click on Admin, enter your password and Copy the Full Access API Key.

When a Bicep file or an ARM JSON template is submitted to a deployment stack, it defines the resources that are managed by the stack. If a resource that was previously included in the template is removed, it will either be detached or deleted based on the specified actionOnUnmanage behaviour of the deployment stack. Similar to other Azure resources, access to the deployment stack can be restricted using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). To create and update a deployment stack, you can utilize Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal, along with Bicep files. These Bicep files are compiled into ARM JSON templates, which are then deployed as a deployment object by the stack.\\n:::\\n\\n:::tip\\nCheck out a previous post I did on [Deployment Stacks](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/Azure-Bicep-Deployment-with-Deployment-Stacks/) for a bit more detail on how they can be used and setup.\\n:::\\n\\nIn our demo, we will have a Resource Group, with an existing Storage account already pre created *(using the Azure Portal)* and a Deployment Stack, consisting of an Azure KeyVault deployed using Bicep.\\n\\nThe PowerShell command used to deploy the Bicep is:\\n\\n```powershell\\nNew-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack `\\n  -Name \\"MyDeploymentStack\\" `\\n  -ResourceGroupName \\"deploymentstacks-rg\\" `\\n  -TemplateFile \\"main.bicep\\" `\\n  -DenySettingsMode \\"none\\"\\n```\\n\\nAnd the Bicep we initially deployed *(where the Storage account isn\'t part of the Deployment Stack, and the KeyVault is a dummy resource for something to deploy)* is:\\n\\n```bicep\\n\\nresource storage \'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-01-01\' existing = {\\n  name: \'stfacc1337\'\\n}\\n\\nresource keyvault \'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2023-07-01\' = {\\n  name: \'keyvaulstest13345\'\\n  location:  resourceGroup().location\\n  \\n  properties: {\\n    accessPolicies: [\\n      {\\n        tenantId: subscription().tenantId\\n        objectId: \'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\'\\n        permissions: {\\n          keys: [\'all\']\\n          secrets: [\'all\']\\n          certificates: [\'all\']\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ]\\n    \\n    sku: {\\n      family:   \'A\'\\n      name:  \'standard\'\\n    }\\ntenantId: subscription().tenantId\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n![Deployment Stack - Missing Storage account](DeploymentStack_LackingStgAccount.png)\\n\\nAs you can see, even though the \'stfacc1337\' storage account is tested as a referenceable object in Bicep by using the [existing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/existing-resource?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) flag, it hasn\'t been brought into the Deployment Stack.\\n\\nBeing able to reference the module in Bicep isn\'t enough to bring it into the Deployment Stack, and this is by design *([Issue #146](https://github.com/Azure/deployment-stacks/issues/146))*.\\n\\n> So, if you can\'t reference an existing resource, how can you bring it into the deployment stack?\\n\\n:::warning[Answer!]\\n**The answer is: You need to import it into the Bicep!**\\nFrom this moment forward, it would be wise to manage that imported resource in Bicep. Any changes to that resource outside of the Bicep will conflict with the code and state, and you may find your changes being reversed on the next deployment.\\n:::\\n\\nA resource needs to exist in Infrastructure as Code, in order to be added to a Deployment Stack, the easiest way is to import it.\\n\\nI did a separate [blog article](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/azure-bicep-and-insert-resource/) on using the Bicep Visual Studio extension to import an existing resource, so refer to that, but in essence, it can import the resource from ARM, and compile it into an identical resource into Bicep, matching what you have deployed.\\n\\nThe Bicep now looks like this:\\n\\n```bicep\\n@description(\'Generated from /subscriptions/a42e282a-c1e4-4abc-9fa1-1dd1ecbd6bf9/resourceGroups/deploymentstacks-rg/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/stfacc1337\')\\nresource stfacc \'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-01-01\' = {\\n  sku: {\\n    name: \'Standard_RAGRS\'\\n  }\\n  kind: \'StorageV2\'\\n  name: \'stfacc1337\'\\n  location: \'australiaeast\'\\n  tags: {}\\n  properties: {\\n    dnsEndpointType: \'Standard\'\\n    defaultToOAuthAuthentication: false\\n    publicNetworkAccess: \'Enabled\'\\n    allowCrossTenantReplication: false\\n    minimumTlsVersion: \'TLS1_2\'\\n    allowBlobPublicAccess: false\\n    allowSharedKeyAccess: true\\n    networkAcls: {\\n      ipv6Rules: []\\n      bypass: \'AzureServices\'\\n      virtualNetworkRules: []\\n      ipRules: []\\n      defaultAction: \'Allow\'\\n    }\\n    supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true\\n    encryption: {\\n      requireInfrastructureEncryption: false\\n      services: {\\n        file: {\\n          keyType: \'Account\'\\n          enabled: true\\n        }\\n        blob: {\\n          keyType: \'Account\'\\n          enabled: true\\n        }\\n      }\\n      keySource: \'Microsoft.Storage\'\\n    }\\n    accessTier: \'Hot\'\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nresource keyvault \'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2023-07-01\' = {\\n  name: \'keyvaulstest13345\'\\n  location:  resourceGroup().location\\n  \\n  properties: {\\n    accessPolicies: [\\n      {\\n        tenantId: subscription().tenantId\\n        objectId: \'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\'\\n        permissions: {\\n          keys: [\'all\']\\n          secrets: [\'all\']\\n          certificates: [\'all\']\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ]\\n    \\n    sku: {\\n      family:   \'A\'\\n      name:  \'standard\'\\n    }\\ntenantId: subscription().tenantId\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nNow redeploy the Deployment Stack.\\n\\n:::tip\\nThe create-stack commands can also be used to update deployment stacks!\\n:::\\n\\n> Once your Deployment Stack has been deployed, your resource is now imported.\\n\\n![Deployment Stacks - Including Storage account](DeploymentStack_IncludingStgAccount.png)"},{"id":"azure/service-namespace-invalid-eventhub","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/service-namespace-invalid-eventhub","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-05-ServiceNamespaceInvalidEventHub/index.mdx","title":"The specified service namespace is invalid EventHub","description":"The specified service namespace is invalid when attempting to deploy an Azure EventHub using Bicep","date":"2024-01-05T07:52:10.785Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":0.81,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"The specified service namespace is invalid EventHub","description":"The specified service namespace is invalid when attempting to deploy an Azure EventHub using Bicep","metaTitle":"The specified service namespace is invalid EventHub","metaDescription":"The specified service namespace is invalid when attempting to deploy an Azure EventHub using Bicep","date":"2024-01-05T07:52:10.785Z","tags":["Azure"],"categories":["Azure"],"authors":["Luke"],"header":{"teaser":"EventHub_ServiceNamespaceisInvalid.png"},"slug":"azure/service-namespace-invalid-eventhub","keywords":["azure","bicep","eventhub"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Add existing Azure resource to a Deployment Stack","permalink":"/azure/existing-resource-deploymentstack"},"nextItem":{"title":"Deploying and Testing Azure Email Communication Services","permalink":"/azure/azure-email-communication-services"}},"content":"When deploying an Event Hub using Azure Bicep, you may get the following error:\\n\\n    \\"code\\": \\"BadRequest\\",\\n    \\"message\\": \\"The specified service namespace is invalid.

Let us take a closer look:\\n\\n![Microsoft Copilot for Azure](/images/posts/MicrosoftCopilotforAzure_CopilotStack.gif)\\n\\n| **Step** | **Stack** | **Action** |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| 1 | Apps | User enters prompt in portal web interface |\\n| 2 | Apps | Microsoft Bot Framework takes the prompt and sends it to AI orchestration |\\n| 3 | AI orchestration | Does prompt filtering (i.e. Content Safety) |\\n| 4 | AI orchestration | Brings in context (i.e. Azure resource/blade that is opened) |\\n| 5 | AI orchestration | RAG (Retrieval Augmented generation), brings in Microsoft Learn documentation, Azure Resource Graph, Cost Management, Skills, Guardrials (i.e. Azure policy, RBAC (Role Based Access Control), Budgets |\\n| 6 | AI orchestration | Added additional context to Prompt (i.e. metapromot) and ground the data |\\n| 7 | Foundational Model | Metaprompt, supplied to foundational model. |\\n| 8 | Foundational Model | Competition prompt response from foundational model (based on Copilot system prompt and context) |\\n| 9 | Apps | Competition prompt, supplied to user |\\n\\n## Functionality\\n\\nMicrosoft Copilot for Azure is designed to help with the following:\\n\\n* Design\\n* Operate\\n* Optimize\\n* Troubleshoot\\n\\n![Microsoft Copilot for Azure](/images/posts/MicrosoftCopilotforAzure_Circle.PNG)\\n\\nSo let us go through trialling this! All tests below will be done with an account with Owner permissions across Azure.\\n\\n### Design\\n\\n> **Design** - Configure and create the right services.\\n\\nTo test the design pillar of Microsoft Copilot for Azure, I will be using the following prompts to ease in and look at my design elements:\\n\\n* I want to set up a new web application for Internet shopping; what infrastructure should I use?\\n* When setting up a new web service that allows people to purchase my products using Azure services, what infrastructure should I use?\\n* List all suggested Azure services for my internet shopping service and how they could connect together, including considerations.\\n* Create these services\\n* Are there any services I am missing? Also, list all the suggested services in a table, including a column on what each service could be used for when looking at my internet shopping application\\n* What are the recommended requirements that I need to gather to create my scalable and secure Internet shopping application? List requirements, as a list\\n* Give me examples of security requirement questions.\\n\\nAlthough these prompts are very high-level and not as specific as they could be, I approached this as someone who was new to Azure design, with a specific outcome I wanted, with one prompt building on the next.\\n\\n![Microsoft Copilot for Azure - Design](/images/posts/MicrosoftCopilotforAzure_PillarTest_Design.gif)\\n\\n> Overall, Copilot for Azure responded to each prompt, and starting off with a generic prompt, I was able to use the completition prompts, supplied back to me. I did like how most prompts included links to additional Microsoft Learn documentation *(including Azure architecture centre references)* based on the subjects at the time. I did ask Microsoft Copilot for Azure to create a range of Cloud-native services, and it failed, so from my perspective, it is missing either additional error handling or the Skills/Tasks to complete the creation of these services *(which would have been my ideal state)*.\\n\\n### Operate\\n\\n> **Operate** - Answer questions, author complex commands, and manage resources.\\n\\nTo test the Operate pillar of Microsoft Copilot for Azure, I will be using the following prompts to ease in and look at the Operate elements:\\n\\n* Take me to view all resources\\n* Change portal theme to light\\n* Change back\\n* Create a table of all resources and their region?\\n* Give me a list of the top resource types?\\n* List all virtual machines and their power state?\\n* Shutdown all virtual machines currently running\\n* Start all virtual machines currently stopped\\n\\n![Microsoft Copilot for Azure - Operate](/images/posts/MicrosoftCopilotforAzure_PillarTest_Operate.gif)\\n\\n> Copilot for Azure responded to each prompt; it did a great job of taking us to the resources within the Azure Portal when prompted *(i.e. take me to view all resources)*; it even successfully changed our portal theme and reverted the change. However, I ran into a bug when attempting to shut down and start running Virtual Machines, where the selection prompt wasn\'t fully loaded, and I had to reset the selection to get it to display. Multiple times, I ran into issues with Azure Resource Graph, not being fully capable of creating and running queries, such as listing all resources and their regions, which I know is accessible by a Resource Graph query. However, Copilot, for Microsoft Azure, was able to successfully stop and start my virtual machines in bulk, making it a lot easier to make adjustments at scale; overall, I believe there are some improvements needed in this area to make it more functional.\\n\\n### Optimize\\n\\n> **Optimize** - Improve costs, scalability, and reliability through recommendations for your environment.\\n\\nTo test the Optimize pillar of Microsoft Copilot for Azure, I will be using the following prompts to ease in and look at the Optimize elements:\\n\\n* List all recommendations from Azure Advisor?\\n* Show me the highest resource costs for the past 12 months?\\n* How can I optimize my environment?\\n* Create a naming convention for SQL databases?\\n* How can I protect my storage accounts?\\n\\n> Copilot for Azure responded to each prompt, and it was able to achieve and display the highest resource costs for the past 12 months; once my scope was set *(as per current limitations)*, it gave me recommendations on how I could generally optimize my environment, Copilot was also able to give recommendations on *(non-Azure)* SQL Database naming standards and implementations. Being able to review and recommend security recommendations is an enhanced Azure Copilot skill; so glad to know this worked and came back with valid recommendations for my test storage account; the automated implementation of security recommendations, however, isn\'t currently implemented.\\n\\n![Microsoft Copilot for Azure - Optimize](/images/posts/MicrosoftCopilotforAzure_PillarTest_Optimize.gif)\\n\\n### Troubleshoot\\n\\n> **Troubleshoot** - Orchestrate across Azure services for insights to summarize issues, identify causes and suggest solutions.\\n\\nIn this section, one of my Virtual Machines *(VM-1)* is turned off, so I am unable to RDP to it; let us see if we can use Microsoft Copilot for Azure to troubleshoot this.\\n\\nTo test the Troubleshoot pillar of Microsoft Copilot for Azure, I will be using the following prompts to ease in and look at the Troubleshoot elements:\\n\\n* How can I troubleshoot not being able to RDP to VM-1?\\n* Check if port 3390 is open on VM-1?\\n* What are the security implications of opening port 3389?\\n* Create a PowerShell script to test 3389 is opened on VM-1\\n* Adjust the script to use its public IP instead\\n* Take me to VM-1\\n* What is the Public IP of VM-1?\\n* What is this resource?\\n* What are the open alerts?\\n\\n> Overall, using Microsoft Copilot for Azure to Troubleshoot RDP to connectivity to \'VM-1\' would have helped, though the scenario that Copilot had come back with was due to being unable to RDP due to a potential brute force attack, had I followed the recommendations, it would have directed me to the appropriate blades, where I saw that the Virtual Machine was turned off. However, Copilot itself didn\'t have a status check that the Virtual Machine was even started or triggered any alerts that the Virtual Machine was deallocated. There was a delay, when I first prompted for how I troubleshoot, enough of a delay that I cancelled it and then reprompted again, which returned a result resulting in 2 of my 10 requests being used up. It was able to supply information on what resource I had opened in the portal and any active alerts on that resource *(Had I been at the All Resources blade; it would have viewed all alerts)*.\\n\\n![Microsoft Copilot for Azure - Troubleshoot](/images/posts/MicrosoftCopilotforAzure_PillarTest_Troubleshoot.gif)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nOverall, I feel Copilot for Microsoft Azure is a suitable companion to working with Microsoft Azure as a *copilot* in the Azure Portal. However, it is clear that this is very much in Preview, and I would argue, unfortunately, not for Commercial or Generally available functionality yet, although I could have high standards on what this could be capable of, so make sure you draw your own conclusions and run your own tests.\\n\\nAs with any prompt, working with LLM *(Large Language Models)*, context is key - and having a curious mindset in your questioning can help draw out more information.\\n\\nIf you are a beginner user of Azure, I feel that Microsoft Copilot for Azure can help point you in the right direction and to the right information.\\n\\nContext is key \u2013 the service takes context on what resource you are at in the Azure Portal, so the more context it has on the resource, the better outputs you will get.\\n\\nAs with all generative AI services, clear prompts are key and don\u2019t trust the outputs; not all Graph queries are right.\\n\\nIn terms of more intermediate and advanced services, it won\u2019t replace full-on Azure management capabilities and troubleshooting yet, remember this is a copilot, an assistant.\\n\\n> The more feedback can be offered using the built-in feedback buttons as part of the user interface, as part of its use \u2013 the better it will be, and the more skills and tasks it will be able to complete.\\n\\nRemember that users can only use Microsoft Copilot for Azure to view resource data and make changes to areas they already have the privilege to do! So as you prepare to roll this out, use it as an opportunity to increase your security and apply just in time and with just enough practice. If you using Infrastructure as Code, then your users may only need Reader access to view data regardless, then Copilot cannot make any changes outside of the toolsets like Terraform you may be deploying.\\n\\nOverall, this is a product I will be following and cannot wait to see what it becomes; where this product shines at the moment is really in the Enhanced Skills and being able to bring the correct Microsoft Learn documentation straight to you while you are in the Azure Portal, making your learning and engagement a lot more streamlined!\\n\\n![Microsoft Copilot for Azure - Enchanced SKills](/images/posts/MicrosoftCopilotforAzure_CopilotEnchancedSkills.png)\\n\\n## Reference\\n\\nThe links below are some relevant reference material for further reading.\\n\\n* [What is Microsoft Copilot for Azure?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/copilot/overview?wt.mc_id=copilot_1a_webpage_gdc&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Join the Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/copilot/overview?wt.mc_id=copilot_1a_webpage_gdc&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#join-the-preview)\\n* [Enchanced Scenarios](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/copilot/get-information-resource-graph?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Simplify IT management with Microsoft Copilot for Azure \u2013 save time and get answers fast](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-infrastructure-blog/simplify-it-management-with-microsoft-copilot-for-azure-save/ba-p/3981106?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)"},{"id":"azure/Azure-DevTest-Subscription-Considerations","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/Azure-DevTest-Subscription-Considerations","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-21-Azure-DevTest-Subscription-Considerations.md","title":"Azure Dev/Test Subscription considerations","description":"When looking at your Dev/Test workloads in Azure, you may be considering the Azure Plan for Dev/Test Enterprise subscription type, available on both the Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) and Enterprise Agreement (EA) billing account types.","date":"2023-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":5.865,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Azure Dev/Test Subscription considerations","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"/images/posts/BlobHeading_Azure-DevTest-Considerations.gif"},"date":"2023-12-21 00:00:00 +1300","slug":"azure/Azure-DevTest-Subscription-Considerations"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Microsoft Copilot for Azure - Preview","permalink":"/azure/microsoft-copilot-azure-preview"},"nextItem":{"title":"Azure Image Builder Image Build with Bicep and Azure DevOps","permalink":"/azure/Azure-Image-Builder-Build-Pipeline-with-Azure-DevOps"}},"content":"When looking at your Dev/Test workloads in Azure, you may be considering the [Azure Plan for Dev/Test Enterprise](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0148p?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) subscription type, available on both the [Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/mca-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/licensing-programs/enterprise?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) billing account types.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nSo, let us look at what this entails...\\n\\n> You get **Azure Plan for DevTest** when you sign the **Microsoft Customer Agreement**. The **Enterprise DevTest** offer is available only to **Enterprise Agreement** customers, but they are *essentially* the **same plan**. The SKU value for Enterprise Dev/Test is: [ms-azr-0148p](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0148p?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and Azure Plan for Dev/Test Enterprise is: [ms-azr-0148g](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0148g?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), but as usual **make sure you clarify and confirm with your direct Microsoft licensing/customer success manager, as these could change**.\\n\\nThere are a few gotchas to using the Dev/Test Enterprise Azure Plan that you need to be aware of, but before we go into that - let us take a look at some of the benefits:\\n\\nRun your development and testing workloads on Azure by using the Azure Plan for DevTest, which includes:\\n\\n* Access to exclusive DevTest images in the gallery, including Windows 8.1 and Windows 10/11 images.\\n* Lower DevTest rates running Windows on Azure Virtual Machines, Azure App Service, Azure Cloud Services, Azure HDInsight, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure SQL Database.\\n* Centralized management via the Azure portal.\\n* The ability to create multiple subscriptions makes the plan ideal for development teams.\\n\\nWhen looking at the DevTest plan, this particular one will catch your eye:\\n\\n> **Lower DevTest rates** running Windows on Azure Virtual Machines, Azure App Service, Azure Cloud Services, Azure HDInsight, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure SQL Database. You can save even more with reservations.\\n\\nWhat this means is that for items like Azure Virtual Machines running Windows as an example, you won\'t be charged the OS *(Operating System)* license costs, so essentially the same cost as if you were running a Linux workload, the same for the SQL services. However, this is a small number of resources *(in comparison to the entire set of services offered by Microsoft Azure)*, which covers standard services that over time can make a huge difference to the cost of running these services.\\n\\n> Provision fast, lean, and highly secure dev/test workloads on Azure\u2014and realize substantial cost savings compared to your production workloads. Your dev/test discounted rates continue as long as you maintain your Visual Studio subscription.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that although the intended readers of this are those with MCA or Enterprise Agreements with Microsoft, for those Visual Studio subscribers, you can go down the Dev/Test subscription route with [PayAsYouGo/DevTest](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0023p/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) with a credit card as well, keep in mind the considerations below.\\n\\nCSP *(Cloud Solution Provider)* doesn\'t currently have a DevTest offer, but you could fall back to the Pay As You Go route.\\n\\n## Considerations\\n\\nNow that we know some of the benefits of the DevTest plans, there are a few things to keep in mind that I have found a few people either didn\'t know *(and these subscriptions were deployed like candy at Halloween across organisations)*or were confused about, so let us cover it here.\\n\\n![VisualStudio Subscription Types](/images/posts/BlobHeading_Azure-DevTest-Considerations.gif)\\n\\nI want it to be perfectly clear: if you meet the criteria to use the DevTest subscriptions, you should! But you might find you will end up with a mix of Pay As You Go and DevTest subscriptions, depending on your requirements *(and that\'s ok!)*.\\n\\n> Remember: The Dev/Test plan is exclusively intended for developing and testing your applications.\\n\\nThe considerations that you need to consider when selecting a Dev/Test subscription type over a Pay As You Go are as follows:\\n\\n* The Dev/Test Azure Plan doesn\'t contain a financially backed service-level agreement *(SLA)*. The only exceptions are Azure DevOps, Azure Monitor and Visual Studio App Center. The entire purpose of this subscription is to give you the ability to trial and test services - and NOT run production workloads or services. This makes sense.\\n* Only active Visual Studio subscribers with standard subscriptions can use the Azure resources running within an Enterprise Dev/Test subscription (yes, that\'s right, everyone who has access to modify/create/delete resources needs to be a Visual Studio subscriber). This is the one that usually catches people out; although there are no technical guardrails preventing subscription use by unlicensed users, you still need to comply with the license agreement. Although it\'s worth pointing out, end users can also access the applications you build on top of the platform to provide feedback or perform acceptance tests without requiring a license.\\n* DevTest subscriptions are also compute quota limited, ie the compute quota restrictions are more restrictive (ie 10 cores on DevTest subscriptions vs 350 quota limit on non-devtest subscriptions).\\n\\n> Even though there is no SLA for any resources deployed in the subscription, Support is still available *(i.e. open support tickets for resources)* if a suitable support plan exists as part of your MCA or Enterprise Agreement or is purchased for that subscription.\\n\\nThose are the two primary considerations that you need to consider when deciding on what subscription type to use; you will find for some teams that have relevant Visual Studio subscriptions, DevTest will work fine, but for others, Pay As You Go will be the right choice - your environment, may end up with a mix of both subscription types - make sure its clear what subscription license type it is, an example is I usually encourage subscriptions to be standing by pre-created ready to go and named something like \'PLACEHOLDER-PAYASYOUGO\' or \'PLACEHOLDER-DEVTEST\', although you can use Tags for this as well - the Overview pane of the Subscription resource also indicates the Subscription type.\\n\\nThe last thing I will cover is what *Visual Studio subscribers* actually mean. To do that, we will take a look at the [Visual Studio subscriptions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\nIf you navigate down the page, you will see a dropdown list with all the Visual Studio subscription types.\\n\\n![VisualStudio Subscription Types](/images/posts/VisualStudio_Subscription-Types.png)\\n\\nIf you click on the Azure tab, you will see the Azure credit *(for their own non-EA or MCA subscription)* and whether they are eligible as a valid Azure Dev/Test subscription user. To make it easier, here is a current table:\\n\\n| **Visual Studio Subscription Type**                             | **Azure Personal Credit** | **Valid Azure Dev/Test user** |\\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|\\n| Visual Studio Enterprise monthly subscriptions                  | $0                        | No                            |\\n| Visual Studio Enterprise subscription                           | $150                      | Yes                           |\\n| Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise              | $150                      | Yes                           |\\n| Visual Studio Professional monthly subscriptions                | $0                        | No                            |\\n|  Visual Studio Professional                                     | $50                       | Yes                           |\\n| Visual Studio Professional subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise | $50                       | Yes                           |\\n| Visual Studio Test Professional subscription                    | $50                       | Yes                           |\\n| MSDN Platforms                                                  | $100                      | Yes                           |\\n\\n*Azure personal credit is in USD.*\\n\\n## Reference\\n\\nThe links below are some relevant reference material for further reading.\\n\\n* [Enterprise Dev/Test](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0148p?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Azure Plan for DevTest](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0148g?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Create an Enterprise Agreement subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-enterprise-subscription?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Create a Microsoft Customer Agreement subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Visual Studio subscriptions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)"},{"id":"azure/Azure-Image-Builder-Build-Pipeline-with-Azure-DevOps","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/Azure-Image-Builder-Build-Pipeline-with-Azure-DevOps","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-22-Azure-Image-Builder-Build-Pipeline-with-Azure-DevOps.md","title":"Azure Image Builder Image Build with Bicep and Azure DevOps","description":"Azure Image Builder is an Azure managed service (running Packer underneath) that allows you to create customised Virtual Machine images.","date":"2023-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":20.55,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Azure Image Builder Image Build with Bicep and Azure DevOps","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"/images/posts/BlobHeading_Azure-Image-Builder-Image-Build-Bicep-Azure-DevOps.png"},"date":"2023-11-22 00:00:00 +1300","slug":"azure/Azure-Image-Builder-Build-Pipeline-with-Azure-DevOps"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Azure Dev/Test Subscription considerations","permalink":"/azure/Azure-DevTest-Subscription-Considerations"},"nextItem":{"title":"Book Review Azure Architecture Explained","permalink":"/azure/misc/Book-Review-Azure-architecture-explained"}},"content":"[Azure Image Builder](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/image-builder-overview?tabs=azure-powershell&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) is an Azure managed service *(running [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) underneath)* that allows you to create customised Virtual Machine images.\\n\\n> By using standardized virtual machine (VM) images, your organization can more easily migrate to the cloud and help ensure consistency in your deployments. Images ordinarily include predefined security, configuration settings, and any necessary software. Setting up your own imaging pipeline requires time, infrastructure, and many other details. With Azure VM Image Builder, you only need to create a configuration that describes your image and submit it to the service where it is built and distributed.\\n> With VM Image Builder, you can migrate your image customization pipeline to Azure as you continue using existing scripts, commands, and processes. You can integrate your core applications into a VM image so that your VMs can take on workloads after the images are created. You can even add configurations to build images for Azure Virtual Desktop as virtual hard discs (VHDs) for use in Azure Stack or for ease of exporting.\\n\\n![Azure Image Builder Image Build with Bicep and Azure DevOps](/images/posts/BlobHeading_Azure-Image-Builder-Image-Build-Bicep-Azure-DevOps.png)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nWith the AIB (Azure Image Builder) service, you can quickly and easily create machine images for Azure environments using standardized virtual machine (VM) images, create a configuration that describes your image and submit it to the service for building and distribution.\\n\\n> When you submit the configuration to the service, Azure creates an image template resource. When the image template resource is made, a staging resource group is created in your Azure subscription in the following format: IT_DestinationResourceGroupTemplateName(GUID). The staging resource group contains files and scripts, which are referenced in the File, Shell, and PowerShell customization in the ScriptURI property.\\n\\nTo run the build, you invoke Run on the VM Image Builder template resource. The service then deploys additional resources for the build, such as a VM, network, disk, and network adapter. If you build an image without using an existing virtual network, VM Image Builder also deploys a public IP and network security group, and it connects to the build VM using Secure Shell (SSH) or Windows Remote Management (WinRM) protocol. If you select an existing virtual network, the service is deployed via Azure Private Link, and a public IP address isn\'t required.\\n\\nWhen the build finishes, all resources are deleted except for the staging resource group and the storage account. You can remove them by deleting the image template resource or leaving them in place to run the build again.\\n\\nTo use Azure Image Builder, you need to create a configuration that describes your image and submit it to the service where it is built and distributed. A high-level workflow is illustrated in the following diagram:\\n\\n![Azure Image Builder Flow](/images/posts/image-builder-flow.png)\\n\\nToday, we will be using Azure Bicep to create the following:\\n\\n* Azure Compute Gallery *(this will be used to hold our Image Template, so we can build our Virtual Machines from it)*\\n* Image definition *(for the purpose, we will using a Windows Server 2022 Marketplace image, with additional customisations)*\\n* Image Template *(this will include our customisations)*\\n* User Assigned Managed Identity *(the user assigned managed identity will be used to build the image and read the blobs from the Azure storage account)*\\n* Azure Storage account *(the Azure storage account, will hold our Application install files)*\\n\\n![Azure Image Builder - Bicep](/images/posts/AIB_Bicep.png)\\n\\nAnd then an Azure DevOps pipeline to deploy and build our template, including an application install of [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/storage-explorer?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and [bginfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/sysinternals/downloads/bginfo?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\nAll the code can be found on my public GitHub repository here: [lukemurraynz/AzureImageBuilder](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/AzureImageBuilder)\\n\\nThe Azure DevOps pipeline will complete the following steps:\\n\\n1. Create a new Azure Resource Group *(if required)*\\n1. Create an Azure storage account *(with public access enabled, and anonymous blob access)*\\n1. Copy the app install files in the /apps/ directory in git to the Azure storage account *(if they don\'t already exist)*\\n1. Deploy the Azure Image Builder infrastructure and Template\\n1. Trigger an Azure CLI command to run the template build\\n1. Adjust public access to the Azure storage account to disable.\\n\\nThe git repository is laid out like so:\\n\\n| Folder       | Description                                              |\\n|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\\n| .pipelines   | Contains CI/CD pipeline configurations and scripts.      |\\n| apps         | Houses application code and related resources.            |\\n| iac          | Stores Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations.      |\\n| scripts      | Contains utility scripts and other automation tools.     |\\n\\nWithin the iac folder is a customizations.bicep file. This file is intended for your image customisations; I intended to keep this separate from the infrastructure for easy modification without impacting any other file.\\n\\n## Azure DevOps Configuration\\n\\n### Create Project\\n\\nBefore we can build an image using Bicep and Azure DevOps, we need to create a project to hold our code.\\n\\n1. Login to your **[Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/)** instance\\n1. Click **+ New Project**\\n1. Type in a **name for the project** *(ie AIB (short for Azure Image Builder))*\\n1. Click **Create**\\n\\n![Azure DevOps - Create Project](/images/posts/CreateADOAIBProject.gif)\\n\\n### Initialize Repo\\n\\nNow that we have our project, we can initialize the repository by cloning the [lukemurraynz/AzureImageBuilder](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/AzureImageBuilder) repository, containing all the code we need.\\n\\n*Note: Due to git limitations, the Azure Storage Explorer install file is unable to be stored in the GitHub repository, for my demo. I will upload it to Azure DevOps after the clone. It\'s not recommended to store the binary files for large installs in Git directly for production and to store them in an Azure storage account. This process can be modified to skip the copy application step and install existing files from the Azure storage account.*\\n\\n1. Login to your **[Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/)** instance\\n1. **Navigate** to your **AIB** project\\n1. Click **Repos**\\n1. Click **Import**\\n1. Make sure the repository type is: **Git** and clone **URL** is: [https://github.com/lukemurraynz/AzureImageBuilder](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/AzureImageBuilder)\\n1. Click **Import**\\n\\n![Azure DevOps - Create Project](/images/posts/ImportADOAIBProject.gif)\\n\\n### Create Azure Service Connection\\n\\nNow that we have our repository and the base code - we need a service connection. This connection will allow our Azure DevOps pipeline authorization to our Microsoft Azure subscription. To do this, we will use, the new [Workload Identity Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), which allows us to authenticate to Azure, without worrying about secret management.\\n\\n1. Login to your **[Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/)** instance\\n1. **Navigate** to your **AIB** project\\n1. Click on **Project Settings**\\n1. Click on **Service connections**\\n1. Click on **Create service connection**\\n1. Select **Azure Resource Manager**\\n1. Click **Next**\\n1. Click **Workload Identity federation (automatic)**\\n1. Click **Next**\\n1. Select your **Subscription** *(after authenticating to Azure)*, and give it a **name** *(you will need the name for the Pipeline)*.\\n1. Click **Save**\\n\\nNote: Consider scoping your Service Connection to the individual Image Builder Resource Group for the least permissions.\\n\\n![Azure DevOps - Create Service Connection](/images/posts/CreateAzureServiceConnectionAIBProject.gif)\\n\\n### Import Pipeline\\n\\nNow that we have our Service Connection let us import our pipeline, which will be used to run our image build.\\n\\n1. Login to your **[Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/)** instance\\n1. **Navigate** to your **AIB** project\\n1. Click **Pipelines**\\n1. Click **Create pipeline**\\n1. Specify **Azure Repos Git**\\n1. Select your **repository** *(ie AIB)*\\n1. Select **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file**\\n1. Under the **dropdown** list for the Path, select: **/.pipelines/azure-pipelines.yml**\\n1. Click **Continue**\\n1. Click on the ellipsis and select **Save**\\n\\n![Azure DevOps - Create Project](/images/posts/Import-AzureDevOpsPiipeline-AIBProject.gif)\\n\\n### Edit Pipeline to use service connection\\n\\nNow that the pipeline has been imported, we need to edit it to use the Azure resource manager service connection we created earlier. Make sure you know the name of your service connection *(ie ServiceConnection-AIB)*\\n\\n1. Login to your **[Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/)** instance\\n1. **Navigate** to your **AIB** project\\n1. Click **Pipelines**\\n1. Click on your **Pipelines**, select **Edit**\\n1. The Service Connection has been created as a **Variable**, named **serviceconnection** in the pipeline, so we need to update the section:\\n\\n    serviceconnection: azserviceconnections\\n\\nTo match the name of our service connection:\\n\\n    serviceconnection: ServiceConnection-AIB\\n\\nThen click **Save**\\n\\n*Note: The Pipeline, by default, is set to run automatically; when it triggers a new commit to the main branch of the repo, you can adjust this to None else. It will try to run and fail *(as its missing variables, etc)*. If you do this, you can trigger the pipeline manually, but it depends on your requirements; as part of the testing - I liked that it automatically ran on every change to the code without having been manually triggered.*\\n\\n![Azure DevOps - Edit Pipeline](/images/posts/Edit-AzureDevOpsPiipelineServiceConnection-AIBProject.gif)\\n\\n### Edit Pipeline to add variables\\n\\nHere is where some of the customisation comes into play. The pipeline is looking for the following variables:\\n\\n* imagetemplatename\\n* location\\n* resourceGroupName\\n* storageaccountname\\n\\nThese variables will be consumed by the Azure CLI, to create the Resource Group and Azure Bicep, to create the Image template and Azure storage account, in your preferred region.\\n\\nBecause in my demo, I am creating a \'Windows Server 2022\' image in Australia East, my variables and values will be as follows:\\n\\n| Variables          | Values             |\\n| ------------------ | ------------------ |\\n| storageaccountname | saccimg4545        |\\n| resourceGroupName  | azimagebuild-rg    |\\n| location           | australiaeast      |\\n| imagetemplatename  | server2022template |\\n\\nSo let us add them.\\n\\n1. Login to your **[Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/)** instance\\n1. **Navigate** to your **AIB** project\\n1. Click **Pipelines**\\n1. Click on your **Pipelines**, select **Edit**\\n1. Click **Variables**\\n1. Select **New Variable**\\n1. **Add** the required **variables**, make sure they are unique to your own environment *(ie the storage account name, needs to be globally unique)*\\n1. Click **Save**\\n\\n![Azure DevOps - Edit Pipeline](/images/posts/Save-AzureDevOpsPipelineVariables-AIBProject.gif)\\n\\n> There is an [Azure DevOps Task](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-devops-task?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), to do the build, however its in preview and doesn\'t support elements such as a Virtual Machine restart at this time, so in my Pipeline, I am triggering the build using the Azure CLI.\\n\\n## Bicep Configuration\\n\\nYou can modify the Bicep according to your own environment; items in the \'main.bicep\' file you may want to change *(that I didn\'t turn into a variable)* are:\\n\\n* Compute Gallery Name\\n* Compute Gallery image name\\n* Paired region that the image template will be replicated to. This is set to the same region as my source.\\n* Name of the User Assigned Managed Identity\\n\\n> To reduce build time, the build VM size I am using is custom: Standard_D4ds_v5. If you remove this, it will default to the Standard_D2ds_v4 size, as you only pay for the time that the VM is building and sys prepping; I found the extra cores useful.\\n\\nI separated the Image Template [customization](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-json?tabs=json%2Cazure-powershell&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#properties-customize) components, into its own Bicep module, that gets called into the main variable, I intend the customizations.bicep to be separate from the Azure Image Builder infrastructure components, to reduce impact or data loss, and make it easier for a first timer to customize the image separately, allowing you to revert any changes to the image build itself easily.\\n\\nYou may also want to test [Image Optimization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/vm-boot-optimization?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796); I have this enabled; however, it does add time to the image build process, but could improve your Virtual Machine creation time, could be useful to use in conjunction with a service, like Azure Virtual Desktop.\\n\\n> This is the main file you will want to start modifying for your own image customization; I recommend starting small *(i.e. create a folder)*, then adding the apps and customisations one after the other.\\n\\nAs part of the image build, I am:\\n\\n1. Creating a c:\\\\Apps\\\\ folder\\n2. Setting the timezone *(although this gets overwritten by the sysprep back to UTC)*\\n3. Install the latest Windows Updates\\n4. Restart\\n5. Copy bginfo from the storage account *(this has been copied to the Azure storage account as part of the pipeline step)* to the apps folder. As it is small in size, I am using the File Packer provider to do the copy.\\n6. Copy the Azure Storage Explorer install file from the storage account *(this has been copied to the Azure storage account as part of the pipeline step)* to the apps folder. As this is a larger file, the File packer provider locked up when attempting to copy, so I am leveraging Invoke-RestMethod to download it to the apps folder.\\n7. Extract the bginfo zip file\\n8. Install the Azure Storage Explorer\\n9. Do a final Windows Update install *(in a past life, I\'ve found new updates - ie Visual Studio can popup after application installs, if your image build time is quite long, feel free to remove this step, for me its a personal preference)*\\n10. Do a final restart\\n\\nAs you can see, everything is mostly PowerShell-driven. Be aware of the double backslashes needed as well; for directories, using a single backslash will cause issues, as it is classed as an escape character. When editing the Bicep file, make sure you make sure of the [Bicep Visual Studio code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep). I have also created a base [Codespace](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/Getting-Started-with-GitHub-Codespaces/) in the GitHub repo that you could work from as well.\\n\\nThen, ideally, you can delete your previous image template every month and create a new one with the latest Windows Updates. Hopefully, this has given you enough of a sample to work from.\\n\\n## Run image build deployment\\n\\nSo, we have modified our Bicep and have our pipeline ready to go! It\'s time to run the build and create our Azure resources. We do this from Azure DevOps.\\n\\n1. Login to your **[Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/)** instance\\n1. **Navigate** to your **AIB** project\\n1. Click **Pipelines**\\n1. Click on your **Pipeline**\\n1. Select **Run pipeline**\\n1. Before the pipeline runs, we need to **verify that the Pipeline has permission** to use the service connection\\n1. Select **Verify**\\n1. Select **Approve** to allow the pipeline stages, the ability to use the service principal\\n\\n> If your build Build fails halfway through with the following error when attempting to create the Azure Image Builder resources:\\n> ERROR: {\\"code\\": \\"InvalidTemplateDeployment\\", \\"message\\": \\"Deployment failed with multiple errors: \'Authorization failed for template resource \'e6eaf07c-bb64-57d4-a69a-6d1463a77bdb\' of type \'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments\'.

Owner rights are created for the User Assigned Managed identity role assignments. You can fix this by copying the Object ID of the error, navigating to [Entra ID Enterprise Apps](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/~/AppAppsPreview/menuId~/null), and search by your Object ID. This will find an Enterprise Application, that is used by Azure DevOps to talk to Azure. Copy the Name, and navigate to your Azure subscription, and Access Control (IAM) blade, and add in your Enterprise Application as Owner.\\n\\n> It can take 30+ minutes to build a Virtual Machine; the more customisations, the longer it will take, so please be patient, after the build has kicked off. As part of the build, you can also download and review the packer logs directly from the Storage account that was created in the IT resource group. I highly recommend testing one customization before proceeding to the next until you have the implementation downpack. The build step, if completed, will move to Optimizing, then Distributing to the Compute Gallery before it can be used.\\n\\n![Azure DevOps - Run Pipeline](/images/posts/Run-AzureDevOpsBuildPipeline-AIBProject.gif)\\n\\n## Build Virtual Machine\\n\\nNow that we have successfully built our Windows Server 2022 image, entirely automated using Bicep and Azure DevOps pipeline, let us create a Virtual Machine using the image that now resides in our Compute Gallery. To do this, we will simply use the Azure Portal to build and test from the Compute Gallery.\\n\\n1. Login to the **[Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)**\\n1. Navigate to your **Azure Compute Gallery**\\n1. Click your **Image definition**, which should now have a version associated with it *(ie 1.0.0 (latest version))*\\n1. Click **+ Create VM**\\n1. Navigate through the normal steps to create your virtual machine using your custom template.\\n\\n![Azure Portal - Create Virtual Machine](/images/posts/Create-TestVM-AIBProject.gif)\\n\\nAs you can see, the Virtual Machine has the Apps folder, Azure Storage Explorer installed and the bginfo executable stored as part of the image template.\\n\\n## Code\\n\\nAll the code can be found on my public GitHub repository here: [lukemurraynz/AzureImageBuilder](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/AzureImageBuilder).

This book provides you with a clear path to designing optimal cloud-based solutions in Azure by delving into the platform\'s intricacies.\\n> You\u2019ll begin by understanding the effective and efficient security management and operation techniques in Azure to implement the appropriate configurations in Microsoft Entra ID. Next, you\u2019ll explore how to modernize your applications for the cloud, examining the different computation and storage options, as well as using Azure data solutions to help migrate and monitor workloads. You\u2019ll also learn how to build your solutions, including containers, networking components, security principles, governance, and advanced observability. With practical examples and step-by-step instructions, you can work on infrastructure-as-code to effectively deploy and manage resources in your environment.\\"\\n\\n![Azure Architecture Explained](/images/posts/Review_AzureArchitectureExplained_TitleBoat.jpg)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\n[Azure Architecture Explained](https://www.packtpub.com/product/azure-architecture-explained/9781837634811) is a Packtpub published (in September 2023) book written by the following authors:\\n\\n* [David Rend\xf3n](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daverndn/)\\n* [Brett Hargreaves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bretthargreaves/)\\n\\nForward by [Sarah Kong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konger/)\\n\\n> Although this book was given to me to review (for free, I have no formal relationship with either Packetpub, although I thank them for allowing me to review this book or the Authors, and I am reviewing this book from an entirely independent view), as someone who architects and builds Azure solutions, this is the type of book, I usually would read, based on the title and synopsis, so let us take under the cover...  \\n\\n## Overview of Azure Architecture\\n\\nThe book\'s slogan is \\"A **comprehensive** guide to **building** effective cloud solutions\\".\\n\\n> Architecting solutions in Azure is a **massive** subject, requiring knowledge about the details of specific services, knowledge and understanding of **Cloud adoption**, **well-architected frameworks**, **patterns and practices** and **interoperability** between different services and systems, if one were to use this slogan and book title, I would expect the book to cover across all these areas.\\n\\n![Azure Architecture Book - Courtesy of Bing Image Creator](/images/posts/AzureBook_AzureArchitectureExplained_AIGenerated.jpg)\\n\\nSo let us look to see if the book meets these details...\\n\\n### Cloud Adoption\\n\\nThe book includes a section on the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework, including links, diagrams and explanations of how the Cloud Adoption framework fits in - not only with Microsoft Azure (which is the focus of this book) but with other Clouds as well!\\n\\n**What I liked about the representation of the [Cloud Adoption](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) within this book was - it was enough for a beginner and intermediate in Cloud adoption, to get going - without the need for third-party resources (i.e. resources outside of this book), but for those after a bit more advanced information or detail - supplied the relevant internet links, to the relevant Microsoft Learn resources *(in short format, i.e. bit.ly - so easily can be copied from a hard covered paper book into your browser)*, so the authors didn\'t try to shove a lot of unnecessary detail into the book, but was to the point, as they started the journey into Cloud governance and covered the basics and knowledge at an intermediate level, without a lot of the detail, that you don\'t necessarily need as part of the book.**\\n\\n### Well-Architected Framework\\n\\nIn terms of the Well-Architected framework, however, there needed to be more direct representation, which surprised me, as although the Cloud Adoption Framework guides the Cloud adoption journey, the Well-Architected Framework focuses more on helping you make informed decisions for building systems in These frameworks can work side by side - HOWEVER, having said that...\\n\\nThe Microsoft Well-Architected Framework consists of 5 pillars, these are:\\n\\n* Performance Efficiency\\n* Reliability\\n* Security\\n* Cost Optimization\\n* Operational Excellence\\n\\nUnderneath these pillars are design principles, such as design for business requirements, design for resiliency, design for recovery, etc.\\n\\nThese design principles were woven throughout the implementation portions of the books and, although not directly called out in some areas, had high-level representation that you can subtly pick up.\\n\\n**I believe, reading the [Cloud Adoption](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and [Well-Architected Frameworks](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/well-architected/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), directly on the Microsoft Learn website, can help supplement your understanding of this book, and some of the decisions made by the authors.**\\n\\n### Patterns and practices\\n\\nLet us look at a particular part of the book; my example is the \'Making the Most of the Infrastructure-as-Code for Azure\' section.\\n\\nWhen I talk about patterns and practices, I am thinking of 2 things:\\n\\n1. Does a Pattern provide a prescribed solution to a problem?\\n2. Does a Practice provide an established method or way of working?\\n\\n> \\"Infrastructure-as-code enables organizations to define and manage their infrastructure and application resources in a programmatic and automated manner. Developers and operations teams can use configuration files or scripts to describe their desired Azure infrastructure and deploy it consistently and reliably. This part will discuss how infrastructure-as-code in Azure empowers organizations to optimize their cloud infrastructure, increase productivity, and drive successful digital transformations.\\"\\n\\nThis particular part included Chapters such as:\\n\\n* Governance in Azure\\n* Building Solutions using Azure Bicep\\n* Using Azure Pipelines to Build your Infrastructure in Azure\\n* Continous integration and deployment using Azure DevOps\\nand Tips from the Field!\\n\\nInstead of jumping straight into the build, the authors take the time to explain Azure governance by following the premise of a hypothetical company and that company challenges, and then working on the previous parts of the work, where the authors had done a very prescriptive *(great)* job of the management and creation of relevant Azure resources using the Azure Portal and explain the business challenges that Infrastructure as Code helps with, before jumping into the authoring, management and implementation of Azure Bicep for Infrastructure as Code.\\n\\n**Patterns and practices, in my opinion, are where this build shone through and where the true value is are the Patterns and practices. Throughout this book, the authors explain the WHY and WHAT before presenting the HOW. It was straightforward to follow and build upon what was learnt and discovered from previous chapters.**\\n\\n### Interoperability\\n\\nInteroperability is always very hard to review - the definition of interoperability I am using is *\\"the ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information.\\"* Commonly, how *systems work together*. In the complex world we live in, systems being able to talk to other systems made by other third-party vendors and individuals can be key to successful business outcomes so that it can be a very technically driven area.\\n\\nThis is hard to review when discussing a book-related specifically to Azure architecture *(i.e., this is not a book about connecting Azure services to AWS, etc.)*.\\n\\n![Azure Architecture Book - Courtesy of Bing Image Creator](/images/posts/AzureBook_AzureArchitectureExplained_AIGenerated_Interopability.jpg)\\n\\nHowever, interoperability is a key area for a topic such as Entra ID, to which this book has entire chapters dedicated.\\n\\nThis book has all the problems that all books have! Information Technology changes so rapidly that there\'s a potential risk that the book you just purchased may be out of date.\\nFor context, this book was published in September of 2023 *(22 Sept 2023)*, which would mean a lot of writing and work, then peer-review, assuming both from a technical standpoint and writing standpoint, after the authors initial \'pre-prod\' draft, before it reaches the public. In mid-July of 2023 *(11 July 2023)* Microsoft announced a rename of Azure Active Directory to Entra ID. There was mention of the rename, but Azure AD was still used in certain areas of the book.\\n\\nIn the context of this book, Entra ID is referred to by its previous name, Azure Active Directory; as a reader who is aware of that rename, it was still incredibly easy to read and follow.\\n\\nThe book explains user identities, the differences between authentication and authorization *(Which I loved!)* and how Azure Active Directory *(i.e. Entrea ID)* can be used to integrate and secure applications and work alongside the rest of the Microsoft Entra ID suite of products, all within the context of a fictitious company, allowing you to follow on.\\n\\n**Overall, I believe the interoperability portions of Identity in this book are first class, from the creation of your first tenancy to Role Based Access to Azure resources; the authors do a great job in explaining how identity underpins the platforms and enables connectivity and access to multiple services, that even a beginner can get going quickly, with knowing WHY they are doing the stuff, that the book asks of them!**\\n\\n## Content and Coverage\\n\\nWhen considering Content and Coverage, my main concern here is:\\n\\n* Is the content in this book actually \'actionable\'?\\n* Can I use what I learn in this book in real-world scenarios, or is it entirely hypothetical?\\n\\nI am pleased to say **Yes** to this book; it is both actionable and useful in the real world! I was pleasantly surprised by this!\\n\\nArchitecture can be a very *dry* subject, and there are so many ways you can approach it, for example:\\n\\n| Architect Type          | Focus Area                                                |\\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\\n| **System Architect**    | Design and structure of individual systems or applications. |\\n| **Enterprise Architect**| Aligning IT strategy with overall business strategy.       |\\n| **Solution Architect**  | Designing solutions that meet specific project requirements.|\\n| **Data Architect**      | Designing and managing an organization\'s data architecture.|\\n| **Application Architect**| Designing the structure and interaction of applications.  |\\n| **Network Architect**   | Designing and implementing computer networks.              |\\n| **Security Architect**  | Designing and implementing security measures and controls. |\\n| **Cloud Architect**     | Designing and implementing cloud infrastructure solutions.|\\n| **Infrastructure Architect**| Designing and managing IT infrastructure components.   |\\n| **Integration Architect**| Ensuring seamless integration between different systems.   |\\n| **Business Architect**  | Aligning business processes and IT strategy.              |\\n\\n![Azure Architects - Courtesy of Bing Image Creator](/images/posts/AzureBook_AzureArchitectureExplained_AIGenerated_Architects.jpg)\\n\\n**When I look at this book, I am looking at it from a mix of Cloud, Solution and Infrastructure architecture, mainly due to my own personal journey, and this is where I feel the book fits.**\\n\\nWhen I look at the slogan of the book again, and the word **comprehensive** is used, I believe this is used accurately; the authors did a great book in discussing the WHY, WHAT and HOW of various solutions in the Networking section of this book, the authors covered design considerations for VNET *(Virtual Networks)*, before delving into more advanced topics, such as Network Security and Azure Virtual Virtual WAN, bringing you on the journey that you would take in real life.\\n\\n## Clarity and Accessibility\\n\\n**The authors did a very clear job of explaining, from start to finish, how to create the necessary Azure resources and why you should have created them in the first place. This was very well done. In just about all sections, the words were supplemented with images and diagrams, making it easier to further understand what was happening in the text. Any links to internet websites were done as short links, making it very easy to copy and navigate to, whether you have a physical copy of the book or a digital copy.**\\n\\n## Hands-On Exercises and Tutorials\\n\\n**This book contained valid hands-on exercises and tutorials, allowing you to follow along with the content.**\\n\\nSample code and exercise files were also provided publically on GitHub [PacktPublishing/Azure-Architecture-Explained](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Azure-Architecture-Explained) and [daveRendon/azinsider](https://github.com/daveRendon/azinsider), allowing readers, to easily fork and get a copy of the code required for the relevant exercises, such as creating resources, such as an Azure Virtual Network with Bicep.\\n\\n## Updates and Relevance\\n\\nAt the time of this review (November 2023), this book (published in September 2023) is still entirely relevant; as mentioned earlier, there have been some renames of products from Microsoft that are a \'gotcha\' to know, as part of reading this book, but the theory and implementation steps are entirely relevant.\\n\\nI came across one link to a website [cafbaseline.com](https://cafbaseline.com/) that was not available at the time of reading, but all other links I used were relevant and working!\\n\\n**As with all books, if you come across this book 2-3 years down the track *(i.e. 2025/2026)* make sure you check the publishing date and version and make sure there\'s not a renewer version of this book! This is a book I personally would love to see various revisions and updates to as the world of Microsoft Azure changes!**\\n\\n## Author\'s Expertise\\n\\nI believe the authors have the correct expertise to make this book viable *(and based on my own knowledge, reading this book)* and accurate.\\n\\n* [David Rend\xf3n](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daverndn/) is a Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) and MCT (Microsoft Certified Trainer); these awards themselves require technical validation, and the display of knowledge to help solve organisation problems, and as an MCT, David, has the experience to explain the concepts, in a way that could be easily understood as a beginner.\\n* [Brett Hargreaves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bretthargreaves/) as a current Cloud Practice Lead, with certifications, such as the Azure Solutions Architect Expert and a background in Architect, Brett has the practical know-how to help make this content relevant, to those looking to Architect solutions in Microsoft Azure.\\n\\n**It is my opinion that this duo is indeed suited to write this type of book, and this can be seen from the actionable and valid output of the book itself.**\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n**Azure Architecture Explained is a book containing 409 pages of actionable content.**\\n\\nThe authors draw on their extensive experience and research to provide practical patterns and practices, to help build on the story of starting from scratch, understanding the *big picture* of how complex systems within the Azure ecosystem sit together, with the advice actually to get started and create and modify those resources.\\n\\nThe book is well-structured and full of relevant examples and exercises.\\n\\n> **I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in architecting solutions across Microsoft Azure, and it was very easy to read and consume the content! I feel smarter, having read it. Thank you to the authors for making the effort to write and release this book. It is a good addition to my library of books that I will be referencing in the future! I read this book on a Cruise while relaxing, and it didn\'t feel like I was doing work!**"},{"id":"azure/Working-with-CIDR-Azure-Bicep","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/Working-with-CIDR-Azure-Bicep","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-18-Working-with-CIDR-Azure-Bicep.md","title":"Mastering CIDRs With Azure Bicep","description":"Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method of allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol (IP) packets.","date":"2023-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":1.635,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Mastering CIDRs With Azure Bicep","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"/images/posts/BlogHeading_Mastering-CIDRs-with-Azure-Bicep.gif"},"date":"2023-11-18 00:00:00 +1300","slug":"azure/Working-with-CIDR-Azure-Bicep"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Book Review Azure Architecture Explained","permalink":"/azure/misc/Book-Review-Azure-architecture-explained"},"nextItem":{"title":"IPv6 in Microsoft Azure","permalink":"/azure/IPv6-on-Azure"}},"content":"[Classless Inter-Domain Routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) *(CIDR)* is a method of allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol *(IP)* packets.\\n\\n![Mastering CIDRs With Azure Bicep](/images/posts/BlogHeading_Mastering-CIDRs-with-Azure-Bicep.gif)\\n\\nThis article includes sample Bicep functions for working with CIDR, for Azure Virtual Network and Subnet creation.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n```bicep title=\\"CiDR.bicep\\"\\n    // This function parses the CIDR notation and returns an object with the network address, subnet mask, and other details.\\n    output v6addressspace object = parseCidr(\'2001:db8:1234::/48\')\\n\\n    // This function generates an array of subnets within the specified CIDR block.

IPv6 was designed as the successor protocol for IPv4 with an expanded addressing space. IPv4, which has been in use since 1982, is in the final stages of exhausting its unallocated address space but still carries most Internet traffic.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n> Most recently, [Gateway Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/general-availability-gateway-load-balancer-ipv6-support/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and [Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/public-preview-application-gateway-now-supports-ipv6-frontend/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) has had IPv6 support announced, allowing these services to handle both IPv6 along with IPv4, from client and server.\\n> IPv6 or Internet Protocol Version 6 is an upgrade of IPv4. A network layer protocol allows data communications to pass packets over a network. IPv6 uses 128-bit addressing and supports over 340 trillion trillion devices, a significant improvement over IPv4\u2019s 32-bit addressing scheme that supports over 4.3 billion devices.\\n\\n|                           | IPv4              | IPv6            |\\n| ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |\\n| No. of bits on IP Address | 32                | 128             |\\n| Format                    | decimal           | hexadecimal     |\\n| Capable of Addresses      | 4.3 billion       | infinite number |\\n| How to ping               | \xa0ping XXX.XXX.XXX | ping6           |\\n\\n> Azure Virtual Network enables you to host applications in Azure with IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity within a virtual network and to and from the Internet. Due to the exhaustion of public IPv4 addresses, new networks for mobility and the Internet of Things (IoT) are often built on IPv6.\\n> IPv6 provides a larger address space, improved security, and better performance than IPv4. [Azure Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/ipv6-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) enables you to host applications in Azure with IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity both within a virtual network and to and from the Internet, which is beneficial for expanding the reach of your Azure-hosted applications into the growing mobile and Internet of Things markets\\n\\n> IPv6 for Azure virtual network is much more full-featured - enabling full IPv6 solution architectures to be deployed in Azure.\\n\\nThere are some current [limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/ipv6-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#limitations) to be aware of, such as:\\n\\n* VPN gateways currently support IPv4 traffic only, but they can still be deployed in a dual-stacked virtual network using Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI commands only.\\n* IPv6-only Virtual Machines or Virtual Machines Scale Sets aren\'t supported; each NIC must include at least one IPv4 IP configuration.\\n* ICMPv6 isn\'t currently supported in Network Security Groups.\\n* Azure Firewall doesn\'t currently support IPv6. It can operate in a dual-stack virtual network using only IPv4, but the firewall subnet must be IPv4-only.\\n\\nAlthough still in a transitory period with some services, Microsoft has come some way to enabling IPv6 dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) services, with [Entra ID even supporting](https://learn.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/azure-ad-ipv6-support?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) running on IPv6, and with US Government mandates like below:\\n\\n> On November 19, 2020, the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued the latest U. S. federal government IPv6-only policy in its memorandum (M-21-07) directing all federal government agencies to complete at least 80% of the transition from IPv4 to the single stack of IPv6 by 2025.\\n\\nThis will be an ever-increasing functionality.\\n\\nAs the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the need for robust and scalable networking solutions has never been greater. IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, offering a range of benefits over its predecessor, IPv4.\\n\\nThere are several benefits of using IPv6 over IPv4, including:\\n\\n* Larger Address Space: IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, which provides a much larger address space than IPv4\'s 32-bit addresses. This means that there are more available addresses, an estimated 340 undecillion addresses, which is essential as the number of devices connected to the internet continues to grow. It was intended to replace\xa0IPv4.  _(The primary reason for IPv4 address exhaustion is insufficient capacity to design the original Internet infrastructure. The original designers of the network did not anticipate the rapid growth of the internet and the increasing demand for IP addresses.\xa0This depletion is one of the reasons for the development and deployment of its successor protocol, IPv6)_\\n* Improved Security: IPv6 includes built-in security features such as IPsec, which provides end-to-end encryption and authentication. This helps to ensure that data transmitted over the network is secure and protected from unauthorized access. Since IPv4 was already defined, IPsec is bolted on _(IPSec packets are payload)_, but IPv6 was still being determined, and IPsec is an integral part of IPv6. From the beginning, IPv6 has had the AH and ESP extension headers, something not possible with IPv4.\\n* Better Quality of Service: IPv6 includes features that allow for better quality of service _(QoS)_, such as flow labelling and traffic classification. This helps ensure that critical applications receive the bandwidth and priority they need to function properly. This is especially important for real-time applications like video conferencing and online gaming.\\n* Future-Proofing: IPv6 supports future technologies and applications, such as the Internet of Things _(IoT)_, smart homes/farms and cloud computing. By adopting IPv6, organizations can ensure their networks are ready to support these emerging technologies and applications.\\n\\nThere is [no charge to use Public IPv6 addresses or prefixes](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-public-ipv6-offerings-are-free-as-of-july-31/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), in Microsoft Azure, resources and bandwidth on Azure are charged at the same rates as for IPv4.\\n\\nIn addition, Azure provides tools and services for monitoring and managing IPv6 traffic, such as Azure Network Watcher and Azure Traffic Manager. These tools allow you to monitor network traffic with IP flow verification, for example, that checks if packets from IPv6 are allowed or denied and also tells you what security rule allowed or denied the traffic, diagnose issues, and optimize performance, ensuring that your IPv6-enabled applications and services are running smoothly.\\n\\nIf we look at the Internet Society pulse _(current as of this article)_, 27% of the top 1000 websites globally support IPv6, growing every day.\\n\\n![Internet Society Pulse curates information about levels of IPv6 adoption in countries and networks around the world](/images/posts/IPv6Azure_InternetSecurityPulse_Nov2023.png)\\n\\nThe transition to IPv6 will take time. While many services and platforms already support IPv6, many still need to, and as more and more devices are connected to the internet, the need for IPv6 will only grow. So, we need to be prepared and start preparation and implementation of IPv6 solutions as soon as possible.\\n\\nSo, when you hear IPv6, always consider the following:\\n\\n1. **Availability**: There is no risk of IPv6 IP exhaustion.\\n2. **Cost**: IPv6 IPs cost Azure zero dollars. This could be a trigger for customers to choose Azure.\\n3. **Compliance**: IPv6 mandates are helping governments start their journeys to the cloud.\\n4. **Network Performance**: NATing (Network Address Translation) adds network latency. IPv6 does not require NATing for cross-region traffic.\\n\\n![IPv6 Dual Stack Azure Network](/images/posts/ipv6-sample-diagram.png)\\n\\n## Getting Started with IPv6 in Azure\\n\\n> Azure Virtual WAN currently supports IPv4 traffic only.\\n\\n### Add IPv6 address space to an existing Virtual Network\\n\\nWe can add IPV6 ranges to an existing Azure Virtual Network by adding an IPV6 address range and then dual stacking both IPV4 and IPV6 ranges.\\n\\n> The subnets for IPv6 must be exactly /64 in size.

By monitoring key metrics and logs, you can detect high CPU usage, low memory, network connectivity problems, or security breaches. This allows you to take immediate action and prevent any negative impact on your applications or services.\\n* Reduced downtime: By configuring alerts, you can minimise downtime by being notified of critical events or failures in real time. This allows you to quickly investigate and resolve issues before they escalate, ensuring the availability and reliability of your applications.\\n* Optimized resource utilisation: Alerts help you optimise resource utilization by providing insights into resource usage patterns and trends. By monitoring metrics such as CPU utilisation, memory consumption, or storage capacity, you can identify opportunities for optimisation and cost savings.\\n* Compliance and security: Configuring alerts is essential for maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements and ensuring the security of your Azure resources. By monitoring security logs and detecting suspicious activities or unauthorised access attempts, you can immediately mitigate potential risks and protect your data.\\n* Proactive capacity planning: Alerts provide valuable information for capacity planning and scaling your resources. By monitoring resource utilisation trends over time, you can identify patterns and forecast future resource requirements. This helps you avoid performance bottlenecks and ensure a smooth user experience.\\"\\n\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n[Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA)](https://azure.github.io/azure-monitor-baseline-alerts/welcome/) exists to help you get started with proactive and reactive monitoring straight out of the bat, focused on standard scenarios for your platform and application Landing Zone that are not industry or application-specific.\\n\\nPreviously under the azure/alz-monitor repository, it is now generally available under the [Azure/azure-monitor-baseline-alerts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-monitor-baseline-alerts) GitHub repository.\\n\\nThe objectives of AMBA are to:\\n\\n* Help simplify onboarding to Azure Monitor through a scalable and consistent approach.\\n* Reduce time to identify failure within Azure tenants and platforms (i.e., outages).\\n\\nMore documentation can be found on the official Microsoft Learn documentation page: [Monitor Azure platform landing zone components](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/management-monitor?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n![Monitor your Azure Landing Zone with Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts](/images/posts/BlogHeading_AMBA.gif)\\n\\n> \\"AMBA Provides best practice guidance around creating and configuring Azure Monitor Alerts for Azure services and workload pattern/scenarios).\\"\\n\\nOne of the ways that makes Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA) so useful is the details around the Alerts.\\n\\nReference: [Alerts Details](https://azure.github.io/azure-monitor-baseline-alerts/patterns/alz/Alerts-Details/)\\n\\nOut-of-the-box alerts that are part of the base AMBA solution include (but are not limited to) alerts such as:\\n\\n| **Resource Type**       | **Name**                           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **metricName**                     |\\n| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\\n| automationAccounts      | TotalJob                           | The total number of jobs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | TotalJob                           |\\n| storageAccounts         | Availability                       | The percentage of availability for the storage service or the specified API operation.

Enterprise-Scale landing zone accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale).\\n\\nDeployment is currently done via an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template and can be deployed with the following:\\n\\n* PowerShell\\n* Azure CLI\\n* GitHub Actions\\nDevOps\\n\\nBecause the Azure Monitor Baseline alerts are intended to follow the Azure Landing Zone framework, in accordance with the Ready phase of the Cloud Adoption Framework, the deployment can be scaled across multiple Management groups, such as:\\n\\n* Connectivity\\n* Identity\\n* Management\\n* Service Health\\n* Landing Zone (i.e., Application)\\n\\nOr a single management group/subscription consisting of all features, with Alert processing rules sending relevant subscription alerts to an Action group that will notify by email if an alert is raised.\\n\\nFor my own Azure environment, I only have 2 Subscriptions that sit under the following Management Group hierarchy:\\n\\n![Management Group structure](/images/posts/AMBA_LukeGeekNZMG.png)\\n\\nWe will deploy these initiatives to the MG Management Group, which allows us to then Assign those initiatives to anything beneath it, in our case, the mg-landingzones and trey-platform management groups.\\n\\nAs part of the deployment, we will adjust the following parameters to match our environment:\\n\\n* Management groups\\n* Assignment of PolicySetDefinitions\\n* Resource Group Name and Tags\\n* Location\\n* Action group emails\\n\\nWe can adjust the alert rule parameters, such as the severity, and change their effect, whether they automitigate or adjust the MonitorDisable tag, which can be used to exclude from alert monitoring; we will leave these to the default.\\n\\nMake sure you review and test these policies first! Before proceeding to Production.\\n\\nWe will deploy the ARM template using the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n1. Login to the Azure Portal\\n2. Click on Cloud Shell *(top right)*\\n3. Select your subscription and create a Storage account to host your Cloud Shell drives *(if it hasn\'t already been done)*\\n4.

if I were to deploy a VPN Gateway, it would create the alert rule for me.\\n\\nFinally, if you want to clean up *(delete the resources)*, you can leverage the Start-AMBACleanup.ps1 script; it will leave the Resource Group, Alert processing rules and action group."},{"id":"azure/private-endpoint-traffic-not-appearing-azure-firewall","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/private-endpoint-traffic-not-appearing-azure-firewall","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-03-Private-Endpoint-Traffic-Not-Appearing-Firewall.md","title":"Private Endpoint traffic not appearing in Azure Firewall","description":"Private Endpoint traffic can take a different route than your standard traffic and cause some confusion and dropped packets.","date":"2023-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":2.03,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Private Endpoint traffic not appearing in Azure Firewall","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":false,"header":{"teaser":"/images/posts/BlobHeading_PrivateEndpointtrafficnotappearing.gif"},"date":"2023-10-03 00:00:00 +1300","keywords":["azure","firewall","private endpoint"],"slug":"azure/private-endpoint-traffic-not-appearing-azure-firewall","description":"Private Endpoint traffic can take a different route than your standard traffic and cause some confusion and dropped packets."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Monitor your Azure Landing Zone with Baseline Alerts","permalink":"/azure/Monitor-Azure-LandingZones-with-AMBA"},"nextItem":{"title":"Empowering Resilience with Azure backup services","permalink":"/azure/Empowering-Resilience-with-Azure-backup-services"}},"content":"You may have a situation where you have implemented [Private endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and the traffic from on-premises to those Private Endpoints, either doesn\'t work, even though on-premises firewalls say otherwise, or is working, but doesn\'t appear in the Azure Firewall.\\n\\nI had this recently with [Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), where the endpoints failed to connect once a site-to-site VPN connection _(which was working)_ was replaced with an expressroute connection, but going through the Azure Firewall logs, was unable to see any 443 traffic for Arc, hitting the Firewall even when the connection was working.\\n\\n![Private Endpoint traffic not appearing in Azure Firewall](/images/posts/BlobHeading_PrivateEndpointtrafficnotappearing.gif)\\n\\n> Traffic flow: Onpremises -- (ER Circuit) -- ER gateway -- Secured hub Azure Firewall -- (Vnet Connection) -- PE (Private Endpoint)\\n\\nThe issue was related to how private endpoint traffic is routed differently.\\n\\nIf the traffic has reached the Expressroute gateway from on-premises, with routing intent, normal traffic will be forced to the AzFW first before reaching its destination, as you would think and expect.\\n\\n> However, for the private endpoint scenario, once a Private Endpoint is deployed to any VNET, there will be an automatic system route with the PE IP and prefix /32 installed on all of the linked NICs.\\n> The next hop for this route will be InterfaceEndpoint.\\n> This route will allow the traffic to go directly to the PE, bypassing the routing intent and other user-defined routes that are larger than /32. The /32 route propagates to these areas: Any VPN or ExpressRoute connection to an on-premises system.\\n\\nSee: [Considerations for Hub and Spoke topology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/networking/private-link-hub-spoke-network?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#considerations).\\n\\nIn an Azure Virtual Wide Area Network (VWAN), you could see this route in the virtual hub [effective routes](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-wan/effective-routes-virtual-hub?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and which gets propagated to the expressroute gateway.\\n\\nMy traffic from on-premises to the Azure Arc went directly to the private endpoints (bypassing the Azure Firewall).

It also provides at-scale monitoring and management capabilities for Azure Site Recovery. So, it\'s consistent with Azure\'s native management experiences. Backup center is designed to function well across a large and distributed Azure environment. You can use Backup center to efficiently manage backups spanning multiple workload types, vaults, subscriptions, regions, and Azure Lighthouse tenants.\\"\\n\\n![Backup center](/images/posts/AzureBackupCenter_Portal_Overview.png)\\n\\nAs you can see, Backup center can be used to see manage:\\n\\n* Backup instances\\n* Backup policies\\n* Vaults\\n* Monitor and report on backup jobs\\n* Compliance *(ie Azure Virtual Machines that are not configured for backup)*\\n\\nYou can find the [Backup Center](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_DataProtection/BackupCenterMenuBlade/~/gettingstarted) directly in the Azure Portal.\\n\\n![Backup center](/images/posts/AzurePortal-SearchBackupCenter.png)\\n\\nWe can create and manage these resources by ourselves, but throughout this article, we will refer back to the Backup Center, to take advantage of the single pane of glass and integrate these resources.\\n\\n### Create Vault\\n\\nIn Microsoft Azure, there are two types of Vaults that the Backup center works with. These vaults are:\\n\\n* [Recovery Services vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-recovery-services-vault-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Backup vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-vault-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n\\n![Backup center](/images/posts/AzurePortal_CreateVault_VaultTypes.png)\\n\\nDepending on your requirements depends on which Vault you will need to create _(for our purposes, we will need the Recovery Services vault)_; Backup Center makes it remarkably easy to configure a new vault and select the right vault type by using the wizard.\\n\\n*Please refer to: [Support matrix for Azure Backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-support-matrix?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) for further information.*\\n\\n1. Navigate to **[Backup Center](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_DataProtection/BackupCenterMenuBlade/~/gettingstarted)**\\n1. Click on **Vaults**\\n1. Click **+ Vault**\\n1. Select **Recovery Services vault**\\n1. Select **Continue**\\n1. Specify a **location** and **Resource Group** to house your Recovery Services vault\\n1. Specify your **vault name** *[(abbreviation examples for Azure resources)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-abbreviations?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)*\\n1. Click **Next: Vault properties**\\n\\n> Immutability:\\nI talked a bit about immutability in another blog article: [You Can\'t Touch This: How to Make Your Azure Backup Immutable and Secure](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/you-can-t-touch-this-how-to-make-your-azure-backup-immutable-and-secure/). Essentially an immutable vault, prevents unauthorised changes and restore point deletions, for this article, we will enable it to prevent unintended or malicious data loss (keep in mind with immutable vaults, reducing retention of recovery points is not allowed).\\n\\n1. Check **enabled immutability**, and click **Next: Networking**.\\n1. We can join our Recovery Services vault to our [private network using private endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/backup/private-endpoints?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), forcing Azure Backup and Site Recovery to traverse a private network, for the purposes of this article, we will skip it. **Click Next: Tags**\\n1. **Enter in Tags** *(tags useful for a Recovery Service vault, could be: Application, Support Team, Environment, Cost Center, Criticality)*\\n1. Click **Review + Create**\\n\\n![Create Azure Recovery Services Vault](/images/posts/Create_RSV_BackupCenter_AzurePortal.gif)\\n\\nIf we navigate back to the [Backup Center](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_DataProtection/BackupCenterMenuBlade/~/gettingstarted) and then Vaults (under Manage), we will be able to see the newly created vault.\\n\\nWe now have our Backup solution provisioned for the Cloud Administrator to use, but we next need to define the policies for the backup.\\n\\n### Create Backup Policies\\n\\nNow that we have our Recovery Services vault, we need to create backup policies; these backup policies will help define the frequency of backups, the retention (Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and [vault tiering](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/backup/use-archive-tier-support?pivots=client-portaltier&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#enable-smart-tiering-to-vault-archive-using-a-backup-policy-preview), which enables the Recovery Services Vault to move recovery vaults to an [archive tier](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/archive-tier-support?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#archive-recommendations-only-for-azure-virtual-machines) _(slower to restore, but can be cheaper overall, for those long retention policies)_.\\n\\n> Backup policies are very organisation-specific and can depend a lot on operational and industry requirements; some industries have a legal obligation to store their backups for a certain number of years, the [Azure compliance center documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/compliance/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) may help, around security and data requirements, make sure your backup policies are understood by the business you are working with.\\n\\nFor Contoso, we have the following requirements:\\n\\n| Resource                   | Daily     | Weekly    | Monthly   | Yearly    | Snapshot Retention (Hot) |\\n|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|\\n| **Critical Application DB - Prod**| 7 days - Every 4 Hours   | 4 weeks   | 6 months  | 7 years   | 5 days                   |\\n| **File Server- Prod**            | 7 days   - Every 4 Hours | 6 weeks   | 6 months  | 7 years   | 5 days                   |\\n| **Web Application VM - Dev**     | 20 days   | 8 weeks   | 12 months | 2 years   |  2 days             |\\n| **Database Server - Dev**        | 30 days   | 8 weeks   | 12 months | 2 years   |  2 days            |\\n\\nThere are a few things to call out here:\\n\\n* We can see that for Development, items need to be retained for 2 years\\n* For Production, its 7 years\\n* Snapshots need to be stored for 5 days and 2 days to allow fast restore\\n* Production requires a backup to be taken every 4 hours to reduce RTO *(Recovery point objective)*\\n\\n![Create Azure Recovery Services Vault](/images/posts/rpo-rto-infographic.jpg)\\n\\nIf we take a look at the Snapshot retention, we can leverage [Instant restore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-instant-restore-capability?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) snapshots, to restore the workloads, quickly from the previous 5 days, reducing our time RTO (recovery time objective), and overall impact of an outage or restore, by storing the snapshots locally (as close to the original disk) without putting it (waiting for it) into archive (slower disk), this will incurr more cost, but dramatically reduces restores time. I recommend always keeping a few Instant restore snapshots available for all production systems.\\n\\n![Snapshot](/images/posts/instant-rp-flow.png)\\n\\nLet us create the policies _(we will only create one policy, but the same process can be used to create the others)_.\\n\\n1. Navigate to **[Backup Center](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_DataProtection/BackupCenterMenuBlade/~/gettingstarted)**\\n1. Click on **Backup policies**\\n1. Click **+ Add**\\n1 .Select **Azure Virtual Machines**\\n1. **Select** the **Vault** created earlier\\n1. Click **Continue**\\n1. As this will be the policy for the Critical Application DB, we will specify: **Enhanced** *(due to the multiple backups, [Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) snapshots)*\\n1. Specify a **Policy name**, ie Tier-1-Prod-AppDB\\n1. Specify **Frequency** to: Hourly, Schedule to Every 4 Hours, and Duration: 24 Hours\\n1. Specify **Retain instance recovery snapshots** for \'5\' days\\n1. Update **Daily Backup point** to: 7 days\\n1. **Configure the Weekly backup point** to occur every Sunday and retain for 4 weeks\\n1. **Configure the Monthly backup point** to occur on the first Sunday of the month and retain for 6 months\\n1. **Configure the yearly backup point** to occur on the first Sunday of the year and retain for 7 years\\n1. Select **enable Tiering**, and specify Recommended recovery points\\n1. You can also update the Resource Group name used to store the Snapshots.\\n1. Click **Create**\\n\\n![Snapshot](/images/posts/Create_RSV_AzurePolicyEnhanced.gif)\\n\\nNote: If you want, you can repeat the same process to create any others you need. Remember, with immutable vaults, you cannot reduce the retention (but you can add), so if starting for the first time, keep the retention low until you have a clear direction of what is required. A workload can use the same policy. A Standard _(not Enhanced)_ policy may be all you need for Development workloads.\\n\\n### Add Virtual Machines\\n\\nNow that we have our Recovery Services Vault and custom backup policies, it\'s time to add our Virtual Machines to the backup! To do this, we can use the Backup center to view Virtual Machines that are not getting backed up, and then configure the backup.\\n\\n1. Navigate to **[Backup Center](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_DataProtection/BackupCenterMenuBlade/~/gettingstarted)**\\n1. Click on **Protectable data sources**\\n1. Click on the **ellipsis** of a  Virtual Machine you want to backup\\n1. Click on **Backup**\\n1. **Select** the appropriate **Backup vault** and **policy**\\n1. Click **Enable backup**\\n\\n> Although cross-region restore is now supported on a Recovery Services vault, the second region is read-only (RA-GRS), so make sure you have a backup recovery vault created in the region (and subscription) of the virtual machines you are trying to protect.

You can read more about [Snapshot consistency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-introduction?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#snapshot-consistency).\\n\\n## Monitor Backups\\n\\nNow that we have our Recovery Services Vault, policies and protected items _(backed up Virtual Machines)_, we need to monitor to make sure that the backups are working. Backup center gives us a complete view of Failed, In Progress, and Completed jobs in the overview pane, which is excellent for a quick view of the status across subscriptions and regions.\\n\\n![Azure BackupCenter](/images/posts/Azure_BackupCenter_Overview.png)\\n\\nBut you may want something a bit more detailed; let us look into some of the options for monitoring your backups.\\n\\n### Alerts\\n\\nAs part of operational checks, you may want assurance or a ticket raised if there\'s an issue with a backup; one of the ways to achieve this is to set up an email alert that will send an email if a backup fails.\\n\\nBy default, these types of alerts are enabled out-of-the-box on a recovery services vault; examples of alerts can be found here: [Azure Monitor alerts for Azure Backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-monitoring-built-in-monitor?tabs=recovery-services-vaults&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#azure-monitor-alerts-for-azure-backup), these can be displayed in the Recovery Services Vault or Backup Center blade, immediately.\\n\\n> If a destructive operation, such as stop protection with deleted data is performed, an alert is raised, and an email is sent to subscription owners, admins, and co-admins even if notifications aren\'t configured for the Recovery Services vault.\\n\\n| Type                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                | Example alert scenarios                                                                                          | Benefits                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\\n| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\\n| Built-in Azure Monitor alerts (AMP alerts) | These are alerts that will be available out-of-the-box for customers without needing additional configuration by the customer.                                            | Security scenarios like deleting backup data, soft-delete disabled, vault deleted, etc.                            | Useful for critical scenarios where the customer needs to receive alerts without the possibility of alerts being subverted by a malicious admin. Alerts for destructive operations fall under this category |\\n| Metric alerts                              | Here, Azure Backup will surface backup health-related metrics for customers\' Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults. Customers can write alert rules on these metrics. | Backup health-related scenarios such as backup success alerts, restore success, schedule missed, RPO missed, etc. | Useful for scenarios where customers would like some control over the creation of alert rules but without the overhead of setting up LA or any other custom data store.                                     |\\n| Custom Log Alerts                          | Customers configure their vaults to send data to the Log Analytics workspace and write alert rules on logs.                                                                    | \'N\' consecutive failed backup jobs, Spike in storage consumed, etc.                                               | Useful for scenarios where there is a relatively complex, customer-specific logic needed to generate an alert.                                                                                               |\\n\\nBackup alerts are supported by Azure Monitor, so under [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), and Alerts pane you can see all your other alerts, including Azure Backup alerts from a single pane.\\n\\n![Azure BackupCenter](/images/posts/AzureMonitor_BackupAlert_AzurePortal.png)\\n\\nIf you want to configure notifications via emails for other types of alerts, such as Backup failures, we can use [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) Action Groups and Alert processing rules, to let us know, without having to login to the Azure Portal directly, so let us create an email alert.\\n\\nTo do this, we will create an Action Group and Alert Processing rule.\\n\\n| Component              | Description                                                                                          |\\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Action Group           | An Action Group is a collection of actions or tasks that are executed automatically when an alert that matches specific criteria is triggered.

Azure Site Recovery can also help with migrating workloads outside of Azure, to Azure, for disaster recovery.\\n\\nWhen looking at migrating workloads, to Azure from the VMWare stack, consider the [Azure Site Recovery Deployment Planner for VMware](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-deployment-planner?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) to Azure to assist.\\n\\nFor the purposes of this guide, we will achieve disaster recovery of our virtual machine, by replicating it to another region _(i.e. from Australia East to Central India)_.\\n\\n> Azure Recovery Services contributes to your BCDR strategy:\\nSite Recovery service: Site Recovery helps ensure business continuity by keeping business apps and workloads running during outages. Site Recovery replicates workloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) from a primary site to a secondary location. When an outage occurs at your primary site, you fail over to a secondary location, and access apps from there. After the primary location is running again, you can fail back to it.\\nBackup service: The Azure Backup service keeps your data safe and recoverable.\\n\\n![Azure BackupCenter](/images/posts/CausesITDisasters.png)\\n\\n> Just as important (if not more) than the technology to enable this, clear business requirements and preparation is paramount for a successful disaster recovery solution, I highly recommend the [Azure Business Continuity Guide](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/fasttrack-for-azure/introducing-the-azure-business-continuity-guide/ba-p/3905424?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).

You can use jobs to perform tasks such as data processing, machine learning, or any scenario where on-demand processing is required.\\n> Jobs are tasks that start, run for a finite duration, and exit when finished. Each execution of a job typically performs a single unit of work. Job executions start manually, on a schedule, or in response to events. [Examples of jobs include batch processes that run on demand and scheduled tasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/jobs?tabs=azure-cli&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\nRunning self-hosted agents as event-driven jobs allows you to take advantage of the serverless nature of Azure Container Apps. Jobs execute automatically when a workflow is triggered and exit when the job completes.\\n\\n> Container apps and jobs don\'t support running Docker in containers. Any steps in your workflows that use Docker commands will fail when run on a self-hosted runner or agent in a Container Apps job; other [restrictions also exist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/jobs?tabs=azure-cli&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#jobs-restrictions).\\n\\nFor an Azure DevOps Agent, we want to execute tasks or remove them. This is where Container Apps Jobs and [KEDA](https://keda.sh/) come in handy.\\n\\n> KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling) is an open-source project that provides event-driven autoscaling for Kubernetes workloads. KEDA can scale any container in response to events from various sources such as Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hubs, Azure Storage Queues, Azure Storage Blobs, RabbitMQ, Kafka, and more.\\n\\nOne of the supported scalers is [Azure Pipelines](https://keda.sh/docs/2.11/scalers/azure-pipelines/).\\n\\n*This specification describes the azure-pipelines trigger for Azure Pipelines. It scales based on the number of pipeline runs pending in a given agent pool.*\\n\\nJobs can be triggered in three ways:\\n\\n* Manual jobs are triggered on demand.\\n* Scheduled jobs are triggered at specific times and can run repeatedly.\\n* Event-driven jobs are triggered by a message arriving in a queue.\\n\\nWe will use both **Manual** and **Event-driven**.\\n\\nThe **Manual** job will be run once to create a [placeholder](https://keda.sh/blog/2021-05-27-azure-pipelines-scaler/#placeholder-agent), Azure DevOps agent in the pool.\\n\\n> \\"You cannot queue an Azure Pipelines job on an empty agent pool because Azure Pipelines cannot validate if the pool matches the requirements for the job.\\"\\n\\nAs our Container Jobs are temporary, a placeholder agent **needs to remain** in the Agent pool *(i.e. don\'t delete it)* to keep it active. This agent will be offline and can be Disabled if required in Azure DevOps. The Azure resource, however, can then be deleted.\\n\\nFor the actual agents themselves that will run our code, they will be **event-driven**.\\n\\nTo provision our Azure Container App Job build agents, we will use [Azure Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) to create our resources.\\n\\nOur resources will consist of:\\n\\n* [Internal Container Apps Environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=azure-cli&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#accessibility-levels) (Internal environments have no public endpoints and are deployed with a virtual IP (VIP) mapped to an internal IP address)\\n* [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) with 2 subnets (One subnet for resources, such as Azure Key vault, Container Registry, the other subnet dedicated to the Container App environment)\\n* [Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) (this registry will be used to build and contain our container for the DevOps agent. The container registry will have a private endpoint to the internal network)\\n* [Log Analytics workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) (to hold the Logs from the Container App Environment)\\n* [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) (the key vault will hold our PAT (Personal Access Token), which will be used to join our COntainer App Job agents to the agent pool. The key vault will also be on the internal network, accessed via a private endpoint)\\n* [Azure Private DNS zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/dns/private-dns-privatednszone?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) (the DNS zones, will allow the Container App Environment, to reach the Key vault and Container Registry over the internal network)\\n* [Deployment scripts](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deployment-script-template?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) (these can be deleted afterwards, but they will run the scripts to build our container image, and placeholder agent within the confines of Bicep)*\\n\\nWe will also need a [User Assigned Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) for this article*(and the scope only being to the Resource Group)*I have a pre-created User Assigned Managed identity named:*usrmi*. This Managed identity has the following role assignments to the Resource Group to which the resources will be deployed.\\n\\n| **Role**                   | **Assigned To** | **Notes**                                                                                                                          |\\n|------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| Contributor            | usrmi       | Contributor role on the container registry resource to push the container image and create the Container App Jobs and resources. |\\n| Key Vault Secrets User | usrmi       | Secret Reader to access the Key Vault secrets.                                                                                 |\\n\\nThe cost of the overall solution \'depends\' on how active it is and how it is used.\\n\\n* Resources such as [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), under Consumption, are pay-per-use and dependent on the number of requests and the length of those requests. The idea here is that they only cost something if in use.\\n* [Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/container-registry/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) requires the Premium SKU for Private Endpoint support, but for demo environments, you could get away with a Basic.\\n* [Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/key-vault/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) also depends on the number of transactions and functionality.\\n\\nIt is recommended to do an estimate using the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) in your currency and region to work out the costs, but the true reflection will be once your Azure DevOps pipelines start consuming the infrastructure.\\n\\n## Let us get building\\n\\nTo deploy our environment:\\n\\n![Container App Jobs - High-level architecture](/images/posts/privatecontainerappsjob_architecture.png)\\n\\nWe will Azure Bicep, a User Managed Identity and Resource Group.\\n\\nThe [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) file I have written is scoped to a single Resource Group, but to do this in production and work with your existing resources, it may be better to move it to [modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/modules?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n> All the code required to get this to work can be found in the following GitHub repository: [lukemurraynz/containerapps-selfhosted-agent](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/containerapps-selfhosted-agent), including the [GitHub Codespace](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/Getting-Started-with-GitHub-Codespaces/), configuration I am using to deploy.\\n\\nWe will start with a Resource Group consisting of our Managed Identity.\\n\\n![Azure Container Apps - Resource Group](/images/posts/AzureContainerApps_AzurePortal_ado-containerapp-rg.png)\\n\\n### Prepare - Azure DevOps Agent Pool\\n\\nBefore deploying anything into Azure, we must prepare our Azure DevOps environment.\\n\\n1. Login to your **[Azure DevOps](https://aex.dev.azure.com/)** organisation\\n2. Click on **Organization Settings**\\n3. Click on **Agent Pools**\\n4. Click **Add Pool**\\n5. Select **Self-hosted**\\n6. Give the Agent pool a **name** *(ie containerapp-adoagent - we will need the name later in our Bicep code)*\\n7. Enter a description and click **Create**\\n\\n![Create Azure DevOps - Agent Pool](/images/posts/AzureDevOps_CreateAgentPool_CAPPS.gif)\\n\\nOnce the agent pool has been created, we need our token to allow the Agents to register to the Agent Pool we have just created.\\n\\n*This token is a secret and will be stored in an Azure Key Vault as part of our deployment, allowing the secret to be protected from unauthorised people and allowing you to regenerate the secret when required by updating the key vault secret without having to redeploy any of the infrastructure.*\\n\\n1. Login to your **[Azure DevOps](https://aex.dev.azure.com/)** organisation.\\n2. Click on the little User icon at the top right *(next to your initials)*\\n3. Click on **Personal Access Tokens**\\n4. Click **+ New Token**\\n5. Type in a **name** *(ie JoinADOPool)*\\n6. Specify a valid **expiration date** *(for our demo purposes, we will go with 30 days)*.\\n7. Click **Show all scopes**\\n8. Find **Agent Pools**\\n9. Click **Read & manage**\\n10. Click **Create**\\n11. Copy the Token for later; if you lose this token before it can be uploaded to Key Vault, you will have to generate a new Token.\\n\\n![Create Azure DevOps - Agent Pool](/images/posts/AzureDevOps_CreatePATToken_CAPPS.gif)\\n\\n### Deploy - Azure Container Apps Environment\\n\\nNow that we have our Azure DevOps Agent Pool and PAT token - it is time to deploy our Container Apps infrastructure.\\n\\n> The [deployment scripts](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deployment-script-template?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) used by this solution do not currently support Private Endpoints*(this is coming)*, so during the build process the Container Registry has Public endpoint enabled. This can be disabled after your initial build has been completed if required. If needed, you could add another deployment script to the Container Registry back to private at the end.\\n> If this is the first time you have deployed Container Apps or Container Registry, you may need to register the [providers](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796). This can be done with the following PowerShell commands, against your target subscription, else the deployment will fail:\\n\\n    Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.ContainerRegistry\\n    Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.KeyVault\\n\\nTo proceed, I will use my GitHub Codespace to deploy the Bicep; you could either run your own Codespace if you need it or fork the code [lukemurraynz/containerapps-selfhosted](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/containerapps-selfhosted-agent) and run it locally or from the [Azure CloudShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796). The repository will have any updated code.\\n\\nThe Bicep code will be deployed as follows:\\n\\n```bicep title=\\"main.bicep\\"\\n// Define parameters\\n// https://github.com/lukemurraynz/containerapps-selfhosted-agent\\nparam location string = resourceGroup().location\\n@description(\'The location where the resources will be deployed.

What is it? *insert confused look*\\n\\nMaybe you have been browsing the Microsoft Azure Portal and noticed a new section in the management blade called: Deployment stacks and wondered what it was, and how you can use it.\\n\\nLet us take a look!\\n\\n> Before we get started its worth noting that as of the time of this article, this feature is under Public Preview. Features or ways of working with Deployment Stacks may change, when it becomes generally available. If you run into issues, make sure you have a look at the current [known issues](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/deployment-stacks?tabs=azure-powershell&WT.mc*id=AZ-MVP-5004796#known-issues).\\n\\n![Automate your Azure Bicep deployment with ease using Deployment Stacks](/images/posts/Blog-Header-AzureDeploymentStacks.gif)\\n\\n##### Overview\\n\\n[Azure Deployment Stacks](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/deployment-stacks?tabs=azure-powershell&WT.mc*id=AZ-MVP-5004796) are a type of Azure resource that allows you to manage a group of Azure resources as an atomic unit.\\n\\nWhen you submit a Bicep file or an ARM template to a deployment stack, it defines the resources that are managed by the stack.\\n\\nYou can create and update deployment stacks using Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal along with Bicep files. These Bicep files are transpiled into ARM JSON templates, which are then deployed as a deployment object by the stack.\\n\\nDeployment stacks offer additional capabilities beyond regular deployment resources, such as simplified provisioning and management of resources, preventing undesired modifications to managed resources, efficient environment cleanup, and the ability to utilize standard templates like Bicep, ARM templates, or Template specs.\\n\\n> When planning your deployment and determining which resource groups should be part of the same stack, it\'s important to consider the management lifecycle of those resources, which includes creation, updating, and deletion. For instance, suppose you need to provision some test VMs for various application teams across different resource group scopes.\\n\\n##### Comparisons\\n\\nBefore we dig into it further, it may help to give you a comparison between the different products and where Deployment Stacks, could be used, lets us take a look at a comparison, between similar products, that may come to mind, such as:\\n\\n* Azure Blueprints\\n* Bicep *(on its own)*\\n* Template Specs\\n* Terraform\\n\\n| Feature                 | Deployment Stacks | Azure Blueprints | Using Bicep | Template Specs | Terraform |  \\n|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|  \\n| Management of Resources | Manages a group of Azure resources as an atomic unit. | Defines and deploys a repeatable set of Azure resources that adhere to organizational standards. | Defines and deploys Azure resources using a declarative language. | Defines and deploys reusable infrastructure code using template specs. | Defines and provisions infrastructure resources across various cloud providers using a declarative language. |  \\n| Resource Definition     | Bicep files or ARM JSON templates are used to define the resources managed by the stack. | Blueprint artifacts, including ARM templates, policy assignments, role assignments, and resource groups, are used to define the blueprint. | Bicep files are used to define the Azure resources. | Template specs are used to define reusable infrastructure code. | Terraform configuration files are used to define the infrastructure resources. |  \\n| Access Control          | Access to the deployment stack can be restricted using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). | Access to blueprints is managed through Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). | Access to Azure resources is managed through Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). | Access to template specs is managed through Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). | Access to cloud resources is managed through provider-specific authentication mechanisms. |  \\n| Benefits                | *Simplified provisioning and management of resources as a cohesive entity.*  Preventing undesired modifications to managed resources.*Efficient environment cleanup.*Utilizing standard templates such as Bicep, ARM templates, or Template specs for your deployment stacks. | *Rapidly build and start up new environments with organizational compliance.*  Built-in components for speeding up development and delivery. | *Easier management and deployment of Azure resources.*Improved readability and understanding of resource configurations. | *  Publish libraries of reusable infrastructure code. | *  Infrastructure-as-Code approach for provisioning resources across multiple cloud providers. |  \\n| Deprecation              | N/A | Azure Blueprints (Preview) will be deprecated. | N/A | N/A | N/A |  \\n\\n*It is always recommended to refer to the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/?WT.mc*id=AZ-MVP-5004796) for the most up-to-date and comprehensive information. The comparison table above, was created with the help of AI.*\\n\\nIt is hard to do a complete comparison, as always \'it depends\' on your use cases and requirements, but hopefully this makes it clear where Deployment Stacks come into play (and it does not replace Bicep but works with it for better governance), with out-of-the-box benefits such as:\\n\\n* Simplified provisioning and management of resources across different scopes as a cohesive entity.\\n* Preventing undesired modifications to managed resources through deny settings.\\n* Efficient environment cleanup by employing delete flags during deployment stack updates.\\n* Utilizing standard templates such as Bicep, ARM templates, or Template specs for your deployment stacks.\\n\\n> The key here is that Azure Deployment Stacks, is a native way to treat your infrastructure components as an atmonic unit or stack, so you manage the lifecycle of the resources as a whole vs every resource separately.\\n\\n##### Using Deployment Stacks\\n\\nDeployment stacks requires [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell?WT.mc*id=AZ-MVP-5004796) *(version 10.1.0 or later)* or [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?WT.mc*id=AZ-MVP-5004796) *(version 2.50.0 or later)*.\\n\\nFor the purposes of this article, I will be using PowerShell.\\n\\n###### PowerShell\\n\\nOnce you have the latest Azure PowerShell modules, its time to take a look at the cmdlets, that are offered to us for Deployment Stacks.\\n\\nOpen your PowerShell terminal and type in:\\n\\n```\\nGet-Command -Name *DeploymentStack*\\n```\\n\\n![Get-Command -Name *DeploymentStack*](/images/posts/DeploymentStacks-PowerShellCmdlets.gif)\\nAs you can see, there are a range of cmdlets we have to work with.\\n\\nFor the purpose of this article, I will be using a Bicep file, I already have on hand (unmodified for Deployment Stacks). This bicep file will create:\\n\\n* 2 Virtual Networks\\n* 4 Subnets *(2 subnets in each Virtual Network)*\\n* 4 NSGs *(and assign to each subnet, with Deny All rules)*\\n* Then finally, peer the virtual networks.\\n\\nThis is the Bicep file:\\n\\n```bicep title=\\"main.bicep\\"\\n@description(\'Name of the virtual network.\')\\nparam vnetName string = \'myVnet\'\\n\\n@description(\'Name of

New-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack\\n\\nThe \'New-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack\' cmdlet is the first one we will look into.\\n\\nLet us look at the most common syntax that you may use:\\n\\n```\\nNew-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack -Name \\"<deployment-stack-name>\\" -TemplateFile \\"<bicep-file-name>\\" -DeploymentResourceGroupName \\"<resource-group-name>\\" -DenySettingsMode

\\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  \\n| `-Name`                    | Specifies the name of the deployment stack.

Some of the possible values include:\\n\\n* \\"none\\": No deny settings are applied, allowing all operations on the managed resources.\\n* \\"DenyDelete\\": Denies the delete operation on the managed resources, preventing their deletion.\\n* \\"DenyWriteAndDelete\\": Denies all operations on the managed resources, preventing any modifications or deletions.\\n\\nBy specifying the appropriate DenySettingsMode value, you can control the level of permissions and restrictions on the managed resources within the deployment stack.\\n\\nFor our testing, we will deploy our Azure Virtual Networks, NSGs to a new Deployment Stack, using the DenyDelete DenySettingMode.\\n\\n```\\n$RGName = \'rg-network\'\\n$DenySettings = \'DenyDelete\'\\n$BicepFileName = \'main.bicep\'\\n$DeploymentStackName = \'NetworkProd\'\\n\\nNew-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack -Name $DeploymentStackName -TemplateFile $BicepFileName -ResourceGroupName $RGName -DenySettingsMode $DenySettings -DenySettingsApplyToChildScopes\\n```\\n\\n![New-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack](/images/posts/DeploymentStacks-NewAzResourceGroupDeployment.gif)\\n\\nAs you can see, creating a new Azure Deployment Stack is easy, with no adjustments to the underlying Bicep configuration needed.\\n\\n*Note: If you get an error, that the cmdlet is missing -Name parameter, make sure that the -ResourceGroupName parameter has been added.*\\n\\nIf we navigate to the Azure Portal, we can see the Deployment Stack natively, including the Stack properties, such as what are the actions if resources are removed, what the denyDelete mode is.\\n\\n![New-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack](/images/posts/DeploymentStacks-AzurePortalOverview.gif)\\n\\n###### Testing Deny-Assignment\\n\\nAs we deployed our virtual networks, using the denyDelete assignment, lets take a look and attempt to delete a Network Security Group, before we do that we need to dissociate it from the subnet.\\n\\n*Note: Its worth noting my permissions are: Owner.*\\n\\nWhen I attempted to delete a Network Security Group I get the error below:\\n\\n> Failed to delete network security group \'nsg1\'. Error: The client \'************\' with object id \'cb059544-e63c-4543-930f-4b6e6b7aece1\' has permission to perform action \'Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete\' on scope \'rg-network/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/nsg1\'>nsg1\'; however, the access is denied because of the deny assignment with name \'Deny assignment \'55ebfe82-255d-584a-8579-0e0c9f0219ff\' created by Deployment Stack \'/subscriptions/f0ee3c31-ff51-4d47-beb2-b1204a511f63\'.\\n\\n![Azure Deployment Stack - Delete Resource Test](/images/posts/DeploymentStacks-AzurePortal-DenyAssignmentTest.gif)\\n\\nTo delete the resource, I would need to, do one of the following:\\n\\n* Delete the Deployment Stack (and detach the resources and delete it manually)\\n* Delete the Deployment Stack (and delete all the resources)\\n* Remove from the bicep code and update deployment stack.\\n\\nNote: In our testing, we were able to disassociate the Network Security Group, from the Subnet, because when the deployment stack was deployed - it was with the: denyDelete assignment, not the:\'DenyWriteAndDelete\'.\\n\\n###### Redeploy - Deployment Stack (Portal)\\n\\nUsing the Azure Portal, we can Edit and re-deploy our existing Deployment stack, if you have changes or resources that you may want to roll back:\\n\\n![Azure Deployment Stack - Delete Resource Test](/images/posts/DeploymentStacks-AzurePortal-RedeployDeploymentStack.gif)\\n\\n###### Redeploy - Deployment Stack (Bicep)\\n\\nWhat if we want to make further changes, such as removing resources from our Deployment Stack?\\n\\nIn this example, we will modify our bicep code to remove the second Virtual network, subnets and associated NSGs (Network Security Groups), and remove the resources from Azure completely *(we can unattach them, which will remove them from being managed by the deployment stack)*, but I want my Virtual Network resources to be managed completely by Bicep.\\n\\nWe could use the: Save-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStackTemplate, to save the Deployment Stack to an ARM template, if we wanted to deploy it later.\\n\\n*Note: In the bicep code example supplied earlier I removed everything after NSG2.*\\n\\nWe will run the Set-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack, pointing to the modified bicep code:\\n\\n```\\n$RGName = \'rg-network\'\\n$DenySettings = \'DenyWriteAndDelete\'\\n$BicepFileName = \'main.bicep\'\\n$DeploymentStackName = \'NetworkProd\'\\n\\nSet-AzResourceGroupDeploymentStack -Name $DeploymentStackName -ResourceGroupName $RGName -TemplateFile $BicepFileName -DenySettingsMode $DenySettings -DeleteResources -Verbose -DenySettingsApplyToChildScopes\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, we tell Deployment Stacks to Delete Resources that are no longer part of the stack, and this time we will add the Verbose flag, so we can see what it is doing.\\n\\n![Azure Deployment Stack - Delete Resource Test](/images/posts/DeploymentStacks-PowerShell-RedeployDeploymentStack.gif)\\n\\n*Note: I cut the gif, thats why the timestamps don\'t match, or you could be spending 10 minutes staring at the verbose output.*\\n\\nIf we navigate to the Azure Portal, we can see the deleted resources listed in the Deployment stack history *(only displays the last Deployment stack changes vs keeping a history of everything)*, and the Resource un-managed state has changed to: delete.\\n\\n![Azure Deployment Stack - Delete Resource Test](/images/posts/DeploymentStacks-PowerShell-RedeployDeploymentStackOverview.gif)\\n\\nNote: A manually created Virtual Network in the same Resource Group (but not part of the deployment stack) remained untouched.\\n\\n*I forgot to update, the DenySettings variable, so once I re-deployed with the \'DenyWriteAndDelete\' instead of: \'DenyDelete\'. I was unable to disassociate my Network Security Group.*\\n\\n![Azure Deployment Stack - Delete Resource Test](/images/posts/DeploymentStacks-Portal-NSG_Modification.gif)\\n\\n###### Permissions\\n\\nI have \'Owner\' rights over my own demo subscriptions, so a bit more flexibility than I would have in a Production environment.\\n\\nYou can add [exclusions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/deployment-stacks?tabs=azure-powershell&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#protect-managed-resources-against-deletion) to your Deployment Stack, allowing certain principals or actions to be completed.\\n\\nYou could also create custom role (Microsoft.Resources/deploymentStacks) to be able to Read, Update or delete deployment stacks, giving you the flexibility to allow people to modify their own stacks and redeploy, without accessing to other tooling required and self-service functionality, such as being able to give someone a deployment stack, that the users can then delete the resources and redeploy later straight from the Azure Portal when required for testing."},{"id":"azure/Azure-Bicep-Deploy-Pane","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/Azure-Bicep-Deploy-Pane","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-18-Azure Bicep - Deploy Pane.md","title":"Azure Bicep - Deploy Pane","description":"Working with Azure Bicep using Visual Studio Code, is as native as an experience as you can get, made even better by the Bicep Visual Studio Code extension.","date":"2023-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":1.325,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Azure Bicep - Deploy Pane","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"/images/posts/Header-AzureBicepDeployPane.gif"},"date":"2023-08-18 00:00:00 +1300","slug":"azure/Azure-Bicep-Deploy-Pane"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Azure Bicep Deployment with Deployment Stacks","permalink":"/azure/Azure-Bicep-Deployment-with-Deployment-Stacks"},"nextItem":{"title":"Coding on the Cloud - Getting Started with GitHub Codespaces","permalink":"/azure/Getting-Started-with-GitHub-Codespaces"}},"content":"Working with [Azure Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) using Visual Studio Code, is as native as an experience as you can get, made even better by the [Bicep Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep).\\n\\nThe Bicep Visual Studio Code extension keeps evolving, with a recent (Experimental) feature being added called the **Deploy Pane**.\\n\\n> The Deployment Pane is a UI panel in VSCode that allows you to connect to your Azure subscription and execute validate, deploy & whatif operations and get instant feedback without leaving the editor.\\n\\n![Azure Bicep - Deploy Pane](/images/posts/VisualStudioCode_DeployPane.png)\\n\\nThe Deploy Pane, brings together some key actions:\\n\\n* Deploy\\n* Validate\\n* What-If\\n\\nThe Deploy step, will deploy the Bicep file using the Subscription Scope and ID specified in the pane.\\nThe validate step, will validate that the Bicep syntax is correct for the Azure Resource Manager to process the template.\\nThe What-If step, will let you know what it will deploy and what changes will be made, without having to deploy or touch any resources.\\n\\nTo enable the new Experimental Feature, make sure you are running the latest version of both Bicep, and the Bicep Visual Studio Code extension.\\n\\n1.

You can customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by configuring dev container files to your repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), creating a repeatable codespace configuration for all project users.\\n> GitHub Codespaces run on various VM-based compute options hosted by GitHub.com, which you can configure from 2-core machines up to 32-core machines. You can connect to your codespaces from the browser or locally using an IDE like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.\\n\\nLet\'s delve into [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) a bit more!\\n\\n#### Introduction\\n\\nGitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment provided by GitHub, designed to enhance the coding experience and streamline collaboration for developers. It allows you to create, manage, and access your development environments directly from your web browser. With GitHub Codespaces, you can code, build, test, and debug your projects without setting up complex local development environments on your machine.\\n\\n![Github Codespaces](/images/posts/github_codespaces.png)\\n\\nKey features and benefits of GitHub Codespaces include:\\n\\n* Access Anywhere: You can access your coding environment from anywhere with an internet connection. This is particularly useful for remote work, collaboration, and coding on the go.\\n* Consistency: Codespaces ensure consistency across development environments, which can help avoid the \\"it works on my machine\\" issue often encountered in software development.\\n* Collaboration: Multiple developers can collaborate on the same Codespace simultaneously, making it easier to pair programs, review code, and troubleshoot together in real-time.\\n* Isolation: Each project or repository can have its own isolated Codespace, preventing conflicts between dependencies and configurations.\\n* Quick Setup: Setting up a development environment is quick and easy. You don\'t need to spend time installing and configuring software locally.\\n* Configurability: Codespaces can be customized with extensions, tools, and settings to match your preferred development environment.\\n* Scalability: GitHub Codespaces can scale according to your needs, making it suitable for individual developers and larger teams.\\n* Version Control Integration: Codespaces is tightly integrated with GitHub repositories, making it seamless to switch between your code and the development environment.\\n* Security: Codespaces offer a secure environment for development, as it doesn\'t store sensitive data and is protected by GitHub\'s security measures.\\n* Project Setup: Codespaces can be configured to automatically set up a project with required dependencies and tools, reducing the time needed to get started.\\n\\nGithub Codespaces went into [general availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/general-availability-github-codespaces/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) on August 2021 and is built on top of the [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/) schema.\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\nYou need a [Github](https://github.com/) account to use GitHub Codespaces.\\n\\nGitHub Codespaces are available for developers in every organization. However, organizations can choose whether codespaces created from their repositories will be user-owned or organization-owned.. All personal GitHub.com accounts include a monthly quota of free usage each month.\\n\\nGitHub will provide **users in the Free plan 120 core hours, or 60 hours of run time on a two core codespace, plus 15 GB of storage each month**.\\n\\nFor further pricing information, make sure you review:\\n\\n* [About billing for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces)\\n* [Pricing calculator](https://github.com/pricing/calculator)\\n\\n> Pricing, features and offerings could change at any time. For the most up-to-date information, make sure you review the documentation on github.com.\\n\\nTo use GitHub Codespaces, you need an active repository; by default, Github Codespaces is configured for the repository you set.\\n\\nYou will also need a [supported browser](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/supported-browsers) (the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari are recommended) to view your IDE; in this article, we will be using Visual Studio Code.\\n\\n#### Setting Up GitHub Codespaces\\n\\nGithub Codespaces can be accessed directly from the GitHub interface.\\n\\n1. **Navigate** to a new **repository**\\n2. Click **Code**\\n3. Click **+** in the Codespaces tab to open a new **Codespace** on your repo, by default a Visual Studio Code instance will open in your browser; note the \'funky\' name and URL that create to give you a unique container.\\n\\n_Note: Don\'t worry; nothing is saved to your repository unless you want to commit any changes._\\n\\nYour Codespace is now started and running in a default GitHub-supplied development container.\\n\\n> A development container is a running Docker container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites.\\n\\n![Github Codespaces - Run](/images/posts/OpenCodespace.gif)\\n\\n#### Exploring the Interface\\n\\nOnce you have your Codespace running, you have access to most native [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) capability\'s and all the files in your repository.\\n\\n![Github Codespaces - Overview](/images/posts/Codespaces_VSCode_Overview.png)\\n\\nWe now have our workspace, consisting of Visual Studio code, running in your own docker container! The Host field _(lower left)_ indicates that you are running in a Codespace.\\n\\nOut of the box, Visual Studio Code has git integration, so you can easily commit any changes to the repository as you would if you were working from your local development workstation - this is critical to remember when making a change to your devcontainer configuration - you have to commit it before you can rebuild or you will lose your configuration (we will get to this further in the article).\\n\\nAs its runs in a hosted container, you can switch easily between computers and browsers by opening the Codespace (the same way you created your Codespace, but instead selecting an already running instance) or copying the URL of your Codespace and log back into Github on another computer to go directly to the container instance:\\n\\n![Github Codespaces - Run](/images/posts/Github_Codespaces_OpenRunning.png)\\n\\nIf you leave your Codespace running without interaction, or if you exit your codespace without explicitly stopping it, the codespace will timeout after a period of inactivity and stop running. You can [adjust the timeout](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/setting-your-timeout-period-for-github-codespaces) of your codespace to a maximum of 240 minutes (4 hours) for new Codespaces, but keep in mind you will be charged unless the Codespace is stopped. If the Codespace remains inactive for some time, it could be deleted. You should get an email notification before this happens, but I suggest keeping an eye on your Codespace and ensuring it\'s only running when needed.\\n\\n> Warning: Codespaces compute usage is billed for the duration a codespace is active. If you\'re not using a codespace that remains running and hasn\'t yet timed out, you are billed for the total time that the codespace was active, irrespective of whether you were using it. For more information, see \\"[About billing for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#codespaces-pricing).\\"\\n\\nAs with any Visual Studio Code instance, you can also log in to your GitHub account to pull your settings and extensions, but to keep things clean and distraction-free, you can customize your Codespace instead for only what you or others working in the same repository need.\\n\\n#### Customizing Your Codespace\\n\\nYou can customize your Codespace to suit the project you are working on; some examples I use personally are:\\n\\n* Markdown editing _(for example, my website is hosted on Github Pages, and the formatting is done using Markdown, so I have a devcontainer preconfigured to run Markdown Visual Studio Code extensions and linting, so as soon as I open it - its good to go!)_\\n* Infrastructure as Code development _(I have preconfigured devcontainer, running on a container, that has the latest version of PowerShell, Terraform, Bicep installed and relevant Visual Studio extensions)_\\n\\nI used to install everything locally, to the point when I would be reinstalling Windows every few months. To keep my device clean, I moved to an Azure Virtual Desktop host as my development environment, but Codespaces now give me the flexibility to install what I need (when I need it) within a Linux environment, and I know when I rebuild the Codespace, I will have the latest libraries.\\n\\nThere are a lot of customisation you can do, we won\'t be able to cover all possible customisations in this article, but I aim to cover the basics to get you up and running!\\n\\n##### Setting Sync\\n\\nBefore delving into some of the customisation of the devcontainer configuration itself, let us remember the Visual Studio Code settings sync.\\n\\nIf you are someone who works on the same products and services and has invested time in configuring Visual Studio profiles, there\'s nothing indicating that you can\'t use this in a Github Codespace, especially if it is a trusted repository.\\n\\nYou will already be logged into Visual Studio Code with your GitHub account; you can turn on Setting Sync to have your Visual Studio code settings and profiles sync straight into your devcontainer.\\n\\n![Github Codespaces - Setting Sync](/images/posts/VisualStudioCode_Codespace_TurnonSettingSync.gif)\\n\\nOne of the downsides of this method is the container can get bloated with extensions and configurations you don\'t need, and you will have to turn on Setting Sync each time a Codespace is launched.\\n\\n[Setting Sync](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#turning-on-settings-sync-in-a-codespace) is an easy way to import your configuration from your Desktop into the Cloudspace.\\n\\n##### Codespace templates\\n\\nInstead of spending time, developing your template, you may find a devcontainer template already exists for your use case; some examples consist of:\\n\\n* Ruby on Rails\\n* React\\n* Juypter Notebooks and more.\\n\\nThese [Codespace Templates](https://github.com/codespaces/templates) can easily be launched from the web browser and are a great resource to test the power of Codespace and refer to when customising your own devcontainer.\\n\\n See [devcontainers/template-starter](https://github.com/devcontainers/template-starter) and [devcontainers/feature-starter](https://github.com/devcontainers/feature-starter) for information on creating your own!\\n\\n##### Devcontainers\\n\\nWithin each customised Codespace is a \\"[devcontainer.json](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/)\\" json file, and some containers will have a [dockerfile](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container#_dockerfile).\\n\\nThese files will sit inside a /.devcontainer/ folder at the root of your git repository. It is worth noting that you can have multiple devcontainer files within a single repository; you will be prompted which one to be used when you start the Codespace up.\\n\\nThese files are crucial to customising your devcontainer.\\n\\nAlthough they serve different purposes they can work standalone or together to create a consistent and reproducible development environment for your project.\\n\\n|File | Purpose  |\\n|---|---|\\n|devcontainer.json|  The devcontainer.json file configures how your development environment is set up within the Docker container when using the Remote - Containers extension. |\\n|dockerfile| The dockerfile defines the environment you need for your project. When you create a Codespace, GitHub will use the specified Dockerfile to build a container image that includes all the tools, libraries, and configurations required to work on your project.   |\\n\\nWhen you open your project in a GitHub Codespace that uses a devcontainer.json file, Visual Studio Code will automatically detect the configuration and set up your development environment according to the specified settings.\\n\\nYou can use a dockerfile to define the environment you need for your project. When you create a Codespace, GitHub will use the specified Dockerfile to build a container image that includes all the tools, libraries, and configurations required to work on your project.\\n\\nEven without using a dockerfile, you can install any dependant libraries onto your codespace, but they are lost when the container gets rebuilt; there are certain approved features you can add to your devcontainer file that will be installed when a container is launched, which is great when making sure you are working on with the latest component.\\n\\nThe idea with both these files is to _keep them lean_ and make sure that you are running the components you only need. To keep launch time and performance as quick as possible, it is possible to \'[prebuild](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/about-github-codespaces-prebuilds)\' your image if it is largely complex, but we won\'t be covering that here.\\n\\n###### devcontainer.json\\n\\nLet us take a look at the \'devcontainer.json\' file. As Codespaces uses the [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/implementors/spec/) schema, all the customisations offered such as:\\n\\n* entrypoint\\n* onCreateCommand\\n* customizations\\n* features\\n  \\nCan be used, offering a vast range of customisation opportunities to suit your needs.\\n\\nFor most purposes, you may be able to find you can get away with a devcontainer.json file without having to delve into building your own dockerfile.\\n\\nLet us look into the devcontainer.json file I am using for this blog article:\\n\\n```\\n// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json. For config options, see the\\n// README at: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/markdown\\n{\\n    \\"name\\": \\"Markdown Editing\\",\\n    // Or use a Dockerfile or Docker Compose file. More info: https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile\\n    \\"image\\": \\"mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:bullseye\\",\\n\\n    // Features to add to the dev container. More info: https://containers.dev/features.\\n    // \\"features\\": {},\\n\\n    // Configure tool-specific properties.\\n    \\"customizations\\": {\\n        // Configure properties specific to VS Code.\\n        \\"vscode\\": {            \\n            // Add the IDs of extensions you want to be installed when the container is created.\\n            \\"extensions\\": [\\n                \\"yzhang.markdown-all-in-one\\",\\n                \\"streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker\\",\\n                \\"DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint\\",\\n                \\"shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced\\",\\n                \\"bierner.github-markdown-preview\\"\\n            ]\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Use \'forwardPorts\' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.\\n    // \\"forwardPorts\\": [],\\n\\n    // Use \'postCreateCommand\' to run commands after the container is created.\\n    // \\"postCreateCommand\\": \\"uname -a\\",\\n\\n    // Uncomment to connect as root instead. More info: https://aka.ms/dev-containers-non-root.\\n    // \\"remoteUser\\": \\"root\\"\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nThis was from an already existing template, that had everything I needed from: [devcontainers/templates](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src).\\n\\nA few things stand out:\\n\\n* image\\n* customizations\\n* features\\n\\n1. The image is the docker image, that this Codespace is running.\\n1. Customizations are application-specific customisations, in my example vscode, and the extensions that are automatically provisioned for me when I started this codespace.\\n1. Features, which are currently blank, but will allow us to run scripts to install any relevant dependencies when the container is started.\\n\\nThis json file is a great reference point, as we go into creating our own. You can create your own devcontainer.json file - or we can do it within the devcontainer itself using the Codespaces extension, preinstalled into your new Codespace.\\n\\nIn our newly created Codespace from the Setting up Codespace step earlier, it\'s time to create our own devcontainer. The project we will be working on will be Terraform development, so we want to customise our own codespace for Infrastructure as Code development.\\n\\n1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** (or click View, Command Palette)\\n2. Type in: **Codespaces** _(with the codespaces commands you can rebuild your container, resize and modify your codespace)_\\n3. Select **Add Dev Container Configuration Files**\\n4. Select **Create a new Configuration**\\n5. Type in **Ubuntu**\\n6. Select the latest version (or default)\\n7. In the **[features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features)** list we have the option to install third-party tools and dependencies that will be installed when we launch our Codespace, search for **Terraform**\\n8. Select **Terraform, tflint, and TFGrunt**\\n9. Click **Ok**\\n10. Select **Configure Options**\\n11. Check the **installTFsec** and **instalLTerraformDocs**\\n12. Click **Ok**\\n13. Select the **latest** Terraform version\\n14. Select the latest **Tflint** version\\n\\nThis will now create a devcontainer json file, using a base Ubuntu image, with the latest version of Terraform, tflint and Terragrunt installed!\\n\\n![Github Codespaces - Create](/images/posts/VisualStudioCode_Codespace_CreateTerraform.gif)\\n\\n**Make sure you save and commit the devcontainer.json file to the repository! You have now created your first custom codespace**.\\n\\nYou can now rebuild your container, to run inside your Terraform container:\\n\\n1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** (or click View, Command Palette)\\n2. Type in **Codespaces**\\n3. Select **Full Rebuild Container**\\n4. Accept the prompt. that it will be rebuild with the devcontainer configuration.\\n5. GitHub Codespaces will then grab the Ubuntu image, and the Terraform feature and run.\\n\\n> Note: If the build fails, at the time of writing, there looked to be an issue with the latest version of [terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/supported-terraform-versions/), I pined it to this specific version: 0.48.0, and it fixed it. So edit the JSON file and update latest to the version. Feel free to review my example codespace here: [lukemurraynz/codespaces](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/codespaces/tree/main).\\n\\n1. Once loaded, I can immediately run \'terraform init\'\\n\\n![Github Codespaces - Terraform init](/images/posts/VisualStudioCode_Codespace_Terraforminit.gif)\\n\\nNow that we have Terraform installed, the Azure Terraform and HashiCorp extension - we may want the [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) extension, to help with working with other developers, so let us add this!\\n\\n1. Navigate to the **Extensions**\\n2. Search for **GitLens**\\n3. **Right** click the **extension** button and select \'**Add to devcontainer.json**\'\\n4. Then commit your save, you have now added the GitLens extension into your devcontainer, this will automatically be installed on your next rebuild.\\n\\n![Github Codespaces - Install Extension](/images/posts/VisualStudioCode_Codespace_AddGitLens.gif)\\n\\nNow we have created our own Github Codespaces using devcontainers, using features and adding in extensions, last thing to add is a few settings to Visual Studio Code, such as Format on Save Mode.\\n\\n1. Click on the **Settings** gear\\n2. Click **Settings**\\n3. Search for: **Format**\\n4. Click on the **gear** next to: **Editor: Format On Save**\\n5. Click **Copy** **Setting** **ID**\\n6. **Navigate** to your **devcontainer**.json **file**\\n7. **Under** vscode **customization**, **add** a new **item** called **Settings** and add:\\n  \\n        \\"settings\\": {\\n                \\"editor.formatOnSave\\": true \\n            },\\n\\n8. Intellisense should help you, add it in and any other settings you may want configured. you may want to consider configuring a default formatter or linter for your project.\\n\\n![Github Codespaces - Set Setting](/images/posts/VisualStudioCode_Codespace_AddVSCodeSetting.gif)\\n\\nAs usual, make sure you **Commit the change to the repository**, before you rebuild to confirm the settings have worked.\\n\\n###### dockerfile\\n\\nFor those more complex scenarios, where there may not be a feature or shellscript that you can run as part of the launch, you may want to consider your own dockerfile.\\n\\nIn this example, I am going to use the same scenario, but use a non-devcontainer image for Apache.\\n\\nYou can create a dockerfile in the same repository.\\n\\nTo make this work, you need an adjustment to your devcontainer.json file.\\n\\n1. **Create** a new **file** called: **dockerfile** - in the same location as the \'devcontainer.json\' file\\n2. In the dockerfile **add** the following line:\\n3.\\n        FROM httpd:latest\\n\\n4. **Save**\\n5. In the devcontainer.json file **replace** the image section with:\\n\\n        \\"build\\": {\\n        // Path is relataive to the devcontainer.json file.\\n        \\"dockerfile\\": \\"Dockerfile\\"\\n        },\\n\\n6. Now **start** your **Codespace**\\n7. Github will now grab the image directly from dockerhub and overly your devcontainers configuration on top of it.\\n\\n#### Port Forwarding\\n\\nGithub Codespaces can do port forwarding, which is either Private (ie visible only to your GitHub user), or Public (open to the internet). This is useful for local development and testing.\\n\\nLet us take our Apache, httpd image supplied earlier.\\n\\nIn the same directory, we will **create an index.html** page:\\n\\n```\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang=\\"en\\">\\n<head>\\n    <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\">\\n    <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\">\\n    <title>GitHub Codespace Port Forwarding Test</title>\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n    <h1>Hello, GitHub Codespaces!</h1>\\n    <p>This is a test webpage for port forwarding.</p>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n```\\n\\nAnd **adjust the dockerfile** like so:\\n\\n```\\nFROM httpd:latest\\nCOPY index.html /usr/local/apache2/htdocs\\nEXPOSE 80\\n```\\n\\nThis will take our index.html page and feed it to the apache htdocs folder.\\n\\nThen we go to our **devcontainer.json** file and add these:\\n\\n```\\n  \\"forwardPorts\\": [\\"80\\"],\\n\\n  \\"postStartCommand\\": \\"httpd\\"\\n```\\n\\nNow **save the changes** and **launch** your Codespace.\\n\\nFeel free to review my example codespace here: [lukemurraynz/codespaces](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/codespaces/tree/main).\\n\\n![Github Codespaces - Port Forwarding](/images/posts/VisualStudioCode_Codespace_PortFowarding.gif)\\n\\n#### Working from your own device\\n\\nThis is all great, but sometimes it feels more natural to work from a locally installed Visual Studio Code instance.\\n\\nUsing the: [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) Visual Studio Code extension, you can connect to a Codespace (or start one), directly from your own Visual Studio Code installation.\\n\\n1. Install **[GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces)** extension\\n2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** (or click View, Command Palette)\\n3. Type in **Codespaces**\\n4. Click **Connect to a Codespace**\\n5. Select your codespace\\n\\n![Github Codespaces - Connect to Codespace](/images/posts/VisualStudioCode_Codespace_CodespaceLocally.gif)\\n\\nAs you can see you can now connect to one or multiple GitHub Codespaces, from your own locally installed Visual Studio instance!\\n\\n#### Additional Settings\\n\\nAdditional settings, that can be configured are:\\n\\n* Setup [Prebuild](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/configuring-prebuilds)\\n* Codespace [Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-codespaces) (Repo & Org Level)\\n* [Dotfiles](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles) (Org Level)\\nOrganisation\\n* [Configuring automatic deletion of your codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/configuring-automatic-deletion-of-your-codespaces)\\n\\nHopefully this article has given you a taste of what GitHub Codespaces can do."},{"id":"azure/Move-Azure-Public-IP-to-another-subscription","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/Move-Azure-Public-IP-to-another-subscription","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-11-Move-Azure-Public-IP-to-another-subscription.md","title":"Move an Azure public IP to another subscription","description":"You can move a Public IP address in Microsoft Azure, to a new Subscription (BUT NOT A DIFFERENT REGION).","date":"2023-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":0.5,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Move an Azure public IP to another subscription","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":false,"header":{"teaser":"/images/posts/PublicIP_MoveAnotherSub.png"},"date":"2023-08-11 00:00:00 +1300","slug":"azure/Move-Azure-Public-IP-to-another-subscription"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Coding on the Cloud -

Adjustments/tailoring to some recommendations will be needed to maintain functionality if attempting to implement CIS hardening on standalone systems or a system running in the cloud.\\n>\'Currently, we do not support Azure Active Directory and it is not compatible with our EXISTING Hardened Images.\\n\\nIn fact when you, attempt to create a CIS Level 1 Ubuntu image in the Azure Portal, you get:\\n\\n\\"This image does not support Login with Azure AD.\\"\\n\\n![CIS Image does not support Login with Azure AD](/images/posts/AzurePortal_CIS_Level1_Ubuntu_NoEntraIDLogin.png)\\n\\nHowever, as I go into below, we can indeed login to the CIS hardened image, using the [Microsoft Azure AD based SSH Login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/howto-vm-sign-in-azure-ad-linux?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) extension.\\n\\n> Be wary, that although this works, you may run into issues with operational support of this from CIS, due to the hardening. This is also Entra ID LOGIN (not JOINED!). You won\'t see the device under Entra ID Devices.\\n\\n![Entra ID login to a CIS Hardened Linux Azure Virtual Machine](/images/posts/Blog_Headler-EntraID_login_CIS_Linux_Azure_Virtual_Machine.gif)\\n\\nThere are many security benefits of using Azure AD with SSH log in to Linux VMs in Azure, including:\\n\\n1. Use of your Entra ID (Azure AD) credentials to log in to Azure Linux VMs.\\n1. Get SSH certificate-based authentication without needing to distribute SSH keys to users or provision SSH public keys on any Azure Linux VMs you deploy.\\n1. Reduce reliance on local administrator accounts, credential theft, and weak credentials.\\n1. Password complexity and password lifetime policies configured for Azure AD help secure Linux VMs as well.\\n1. With Azure role-based access control, specify who can login to a VM as a regular user or with administrator privileges. When users join or leave your team, you can update the Azure RBAC policy for the VM to grant access as appropriate. When employees leave your organization and their user account is disabled or removed from Azure AD, they no longer have access to your resources.\\n1. With Conditional Access, configure policies to require multi-factor authentication and/or require client device you are using to SSH be a managed device (for example: compliant device or hybrid Azure AD joined) before you can SSH to Linux VMs.\\n1. Use Azure deploy and audit policies to require Azure AD login for Linux VMs and to flag use of non-approved local accounts on the VMs.\\n\\nSo after your CIS Hardened Image, in my case I am using Ubuntu 20.04 has been deployed in Azure. Lets set this up.\\n\\nYou will need to make sure you have a few prerequsites.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\n#### Network\\n\\nVM network configuration must permit outbound access to the following endpoints over TCP port 443.\\n\\n[https://packages.microsoft.com](https://packages.microsoft.com): For package installation and upgrades.\\n[http://169.254.169.254](http://169.254.169.254): Azure Instance Metadata Service endpoint.\\n[https://login.microsoftonline.com](https://login.microsoftonline.com): For PAM-based (pluggable authentication modules) authentication flows.\\n[https://pas.windows.net](https://pas.windows.net): For Azure RBAC (Role Based Access Control) flows.\\n\\nAlso make sure you have enabled TCP Port 80 for: ubuntu.com, specifically [http://archive.ubuntu.com](http://archive.ubuntu.com) as the Microsoft Azure AD based SSH Login, will need to download and install the following packages: aadsshlogin and aadsshlogin-selinux as needed.\\n\\n#### Virtual Machine\\n\\nThe CIS hardened image, will need to have a [System Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#managed-identity-types) setup. This can be easily enabled in the Identity blade of the Virtual Machine.\\n\\nThe Entra ID (Azure Active Directory) users that need to login with to the Linux Virtual Machine are a member of one of the following Azure RBAC (Role Based Access Control) groups, as per their requirements:\\n\\n| RBAC Role                           | Notes                                                            |\\n| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Virtual Machine Administrator Login | View Virtual Machines in the portal and login as administrator   |\\n| Virtual Machine User Login          | View Virtual Machines in the portal and login as a regular user. |\\n\\nOnly one role is required. These roles are supported for both Windows and Linux.\\n\\n#### Client\\n\\nOn the jumphost, client PC you will be connecting to the Linux virtual machine from, you need the latest [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) with the Azure CLI extension \'ssh\' installed.\\n\\n    az extension add --name ssh\\n\\nThe minimum version required for the extension is 0.1.4.\\n\\n    az extension show --name ssh\\n\\n### Install Extension\\n\\nMake sure the Virtual Machine is on, for the extension to install.\\n\\n##### Install using the Azure Portal\\n\\nOnce the pre-requsites have been met, it is time to install the extension.\\n\\n1. Login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)\\n1. Navigate to your CIS Hardened Virtual Machine\\n1. Click on Extensions + Applications\\n1. Click + Add\\n1. ![Azure Portal - Extensions](/images/posts/AzurePortal_CISHardenedVM_Extensions.png)\\n1. Search for: Azure AD based SSH Login\\n1. ![Azure Portal - SSH Extension](/images/posts/AzurePortal_CISHardenedVM_SSH_Extension.png)\\n1. Select the Azure AD base SSH Login extension\\n1. Click Next\\n1. Click Review and Create\\n1. Click Create\\n\\nAfter a few moments, the extension and supporting components, will be installed. You can check the status under the Extensions + Application blade make sure that Provisioning has been succeded, before provisioning to the next step to login.\\n\\n![Azure Virtual Machine Extension](/images/posts/AzurePortal_CIS_Level1_Ubuntu_ADSSHExtensionStatus.png)\\n\\n##### Install using Terraform\\n\\nYou can use the following Terraform code snippet, to install the extension to a Linux Virtual Machine:\\n\\nMake sure you assign the extension, to the virtual machine, using the ID.\\n\\n    resource \\"azurerm_virtual_machine_extension\\" \\"aad_login\\" {\\n    name                 = \\"AADLogin\\"\\n    virtual_machine_id   = \\n    publisher            = \\"Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory\\"\\n    type                 = \\"AADSSHLoginForLinux\\" # For Windows VMs: AADLoginForWindows\\n    type_handler_version = \\"1.0\\"                 # There may be a more recent version\\n    }\\n\\n##### Install using PowerShell\\n\\nTo install the AADLogin extension to a Linux Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure using PowerShell, you can follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Open PowerShell on your local machine, or [Azure Cloud Shell](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n    Connect-AzAccount\\n    Select-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName \\"Your Subscription Name\\"\\n    $vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName \\"Your Resource Group Name\\" -Name \\"Your VM Name\\"\\n    Set-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName -VMName $vm.Name -Name \\"AADLoginForLinux\\" -Publisher \\"Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.LinuxSSH\\" -Type \\"AADLoginForLinux\\" -TypeHandlerVersion \\"1.0\\"\\n\\n### Login to Virtual Machine\\n\\nNow that the extension is stood, up its time to connect.\\n\\nREMEMBER to make sure that the Entra ID (AAD) accounts you want to login to the Linux image is a member of either of the following roles, directly assigned to the Virtual Machine/Resource Group, or in an Entra ID (AAD) group that has been delegated the permissions.\\n\\n| RBAC Role                           | Notes                                                            |\\n| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Virtual Machine Administrator Login | View Virtual Machines in the portal and login as administrator   |\\n| Virtual Machine User Login          | View Virtual Machines in the portal and login as a regular user. |\\n\\n1. Open a Command Prompt\\n1. Log in to the Azure using:\\n    az login\\n1. A web browser will prompt and ask you to authenticate, where you will go through the MFA (Multifactor Authentication) and complete login to your Entra ID account.\\n1. Once authenicated you can run:\\n    az ssh vm -n cistest -g cistest\\nNote: -n is the VM name and -g is the Resource Group, that the VM is located inside.\\n\\n![Entra ID Login - Linux VM](/images/posts/CISHardenedImageEntraIDLogin.gif)\\n\\nYou should now have successfully authenticated to your Linux virtual machine using Entra ID credendials.\\n\\n### Troubleshooting\\n\\nIf you are unable to connect, it may be due to an issue with the AADSSHLogin extension. You can troubleshoot by reviewing the extension log.\\n\\n    cat /var/log/azure/Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.AADSSHLoginForLinux/CommandExecution.log\\n\\nThe Azure directory is protected, so you will need Administrator rights to delve into the logs."},{"id":"azure/Changing-default-management-group-for-azure","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/Changing-default-management-group-for-azure","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-17-Changing-default-management-group-for-azure.md","title":"Changing the default Management Group in Azure","description":"By default, when a Management Group gets created, it goes under the Root Management Group, the same is true for Subscriptions.","date":"2023-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":1.965,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Changing the default Management Group in Azure","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":false,"header":{"teaser":"/images/posts/ChangeDefaultManagementGroup.png"},"date":"2023-07-17 00:00:00 +1300","slug":"azure/Changing-default-management-group-for-azure"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Entra ID login to a CIS Hardened Linux Azure Virtual Machine","permalink":"/azure/Entra-ID-login-to-a-CIS-Hardened-Linux-Azure-Virtual-Machine"},"nextItem":{"title":"Access denied on Azure VM when using aztfexport","permalink":"/azure/Access-denied-aztfexport"}},"content":"By default, when a [Management Group](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/management-groups/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) gets created, it goes under the Root Management Group, the same is true for [Subscriptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/organize-subscriptions?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\nThis works fine, when you have a simple Microsoft Azure environment, but as soon as you start expanding into areas such as [Subscription vending](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/landing-zones/subscription-vending?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) or limited access to who can see the Root Management Group and start to look into Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions, you may want to consider moving new subscriptions, under its own Management Group, away from any policies or RBAC controls, essentially into a Management Group that acts as a shopping cart, to then be picked up and moved later.\\n\\nIf we refer to a [recommendation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/resource-org-management-groups?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#management-group-recommendations) on the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework:\\n\\n> Configure a default, dedicated management group for new subscriptions.

We will download and extract the document repository locally *(roughly 6 GB)*. To do this, we will use a PowerShell script:\\n\\n         $gitRepoUrl = \\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs\\"\\n         $localPath = \\"C:\\\\temp\\\\azuredocs\\"\\n         $zipPath = \\"C:\\\\temp\\\\azurdocs.zip\\"\\n         #Download the Git repository and extract\\n         Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \\"$gitRepoUrl/archive/master.zip\\" -OutFile $zipPath\\n         Expand-Archive -Path $zipPath -DestinationPath $localPath\\n\\n### Create Azure Storage Account\\n\\nNow that we have a copy of the Azure document repository, it\'s time to create an Azure Storage account to copy the data into. To create this storage account, we will use PowerShell.\\n\\n         # Login to Azure\\n         Connect-AzAccount\\n         # Set variables\\n         $resourceGroupName = \\"azuredocs-ai-rg\\"\\n         $location = \\"eastus\\"\\n         $uniqueId = [guid]::NewGuid().ToString().Substring(0,4)\\n         $storageAccountName = \\"myaistgacc$uniqueId\\"\\n         $containerName = \\"azuredocs\\"\\n         # Create a new resource group\\n         New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location $location\\n         # Create a new storage account\\n         New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $storageAccountName -Location $location -SkuName Standard_LRS -AllowBlobPublicAccess $false\\n         # Create a new blob container\\n         New-AzStorageContainer -Name $containerName -Context (New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName -StorageAccountKey (Get-AzStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $storageAccountName).Value[0])\\n\\nWe have created our Resource Group and Storage account to hold our Azure documentation.\\n\\n### Upload Microsoft Learn documentation to an Azure blob container\\n\\nNow that we have the Azure docs repo downloaded and extracted and an Azure Storage account to hold the documents, it\'s time to use AzCopy to copy the documentation to the Azure storage account.\\nWe will use PowerShell to create a SAS token (open for a day) and use that with AzCopy to copy the Azure repo into our newly created container.\\n\\n         # Set variables\\n         $resourceGroupName = \\"azuredocs-ai-rg\\"\\n         $storageAccountName = \\"myaistgacc958b\\"\\n         $containerName = \\"azuredocs\\"\\n         $storageAccountKey = (Get-AzStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $storageAccountName).Value[0]\\n         $localPath = \\"C:\\\\Temp\\\\azuredocs\\\\azure-docs-main\\"\\n         $azCopyPath = \\"C:\\\\tools\\\\azcopy_windows_amd64_10.19.0\\\\AzCopy.exe\\"\\n         # Construct SAS URL for destination container\\n         $sasToken = (New-AzStorageContainerSASToken -Name $containerName -Context (New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName -StorageAccountKey $storageAccountKey) -Permission rwdl -ExpiryTime (Get-Date).AddDays(1)).TrimStart(\\"?\\")\\n         $destinationUrl = \\"https://$storageAccountName.blob.core.windows.net/$containerName/?$sasToken\\"\\n         # Run AzCopy command as command line\\n         $command = \\"& `\\"$azCopyPath`\\" copy `\\"$localPath`\\" `\\"$destinationUrl`\\" --recursive=true\\"\\n         Invoke-Expression $command\\n\\n*Note: I took roughly 6 minutes to copy the Azure docs repo from my local computer (in New Zealand) into a blob storage account in East US, so roughly a gigabyte a minute.*\\n\\n![Azure Storage Account - Microsoft Learn Docs](/images/posts/AzureStorage_AzureDocs_UploadedAzCopy.png \\"Azure Storage Account - Microsoft Learn Docs\\")\\n\\n### Create Cognitive Search\\n\\nNow that we have our Azure Blob storage accounts, it\'s time to create our Cognitive Search.\\nWe will need to create a Cognitive Search, with an SKU of Standard, to support the 6GBs of Azure documents that must be indexed. Please check your costs; this is roughly NZ$377.96 a month to run; you can reduce this cost by limiting the amount of data you need to index (i.e., only certain documents, not an entire large repository of markdown files). Make sure you refer to the [Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\n         # Set variables\\n         $resourceGroupName = \\"azuredocs-ai-rg\\"\\n         $searchServiceName = \\"azuredocssearchservice\\" #Cognitive Service name needs to be lowercase.\\n         # Create a search service\\n         Install-Module Az.Search\\n         $searchService = New-AzSearchService -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $searchServiceName -Location \\"eastus\\" -Sku Standard\\n\\nNow that the cognitive search has been created, we need to create the index, and indexers, which will index our Azure documents to be used by Azure OpenAI by creating the index and linking it to the Azuredocs blob container, we created earlier.\\n\\n*Note: There is no PowerShell cmdlet support for Azure Cognitive Search indexes; you can create using the [RestAPI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-powershell?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) - but we will do this in the Azure Portal as part of the next step.*\\n\\n### Create Azure Cognitive Search Index\\n\\nIt\'s time to time to create the Cognitive Search Index, an indexer that will index the content.\\n\\nWe will move away from PowerShell and into the Microsoft Azure Portal to do this.\\n\\n1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)\\n1. In the top center search bar, type in Cognitive Search\\n1. Click on [Cognitive Search](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ProjectOxford/AppliedAIHub/~/CognitiveSearch)\\n1. Click on your newly created Cognitive Search\\n![Azure Portal - Cognitive Search](/images/posts/AzurePortal_CognitiveSearch_Resource.png \\"Azure Portal - Cognitive Search\\")\\n1. Select Import Data\\n1. Select Azure Blob Storage\\n![Azure Portal - Cognitive Search - Add Azure Blob Storage](/images/posts/AzurePortal_CognitiveSearch_AddDataStorage.png \\"Azure Portal - Cognitive Search\\")\\n1. Type in your data source name *(i.e., azuredocs)*\\n1. For the Connection string, select Choose an existing connection\\n1. Select your Azure Storage account and a container containing the Azure document repository uploaded earlier.\\n1. Click Select\\n![Azure Portal - Cognitive Search - Add Azure Blob Storage](/images/posts/AzurePortal_CognitiveSearch_ConnectBlobStorage.png \\"Azure Portal - Cognitive Search - Add Azure Blob Storage\\")\\n1. Click Next: Add cognitive skills (Optional)\\n1. Here, you can Enrich your data, such as enabling OCR (extracting text from images automatically) or extracting people\'s names, and translating text from one language to another; these enrichments are billed separately, and we won\'t be using any enrichments so we will select Skip to: Customize target index.\\n1. Here is the index mapping that was done by Cognitive Search automatically by scanning the schema of the documents. You can bring in additional data about your documents if you want, but I am happy with the defaults, so I click: Next: Create an indexer\\n![Azure Portal - Cognitive Search - Search Index](/images/posts/AzurePortal_CognitiveSearch_SearchIndex.png \\"Azure Portal - Cognitive Search - Search Index\\")\\n1. The indexer is what is going to create your index, which will be referenced by Azure OpenAI later; you can schedule an indexer to run hourly, if new data is being added to the Azure blob container where your source files are sitting, for my purposes I am going leave the Schedule as: Once\\n1. Uncollapse Advanced Options and scroll down a bit\\n1. Here, we can select to only index certain files; for our purposes, we are going to exclude png files, the Azure document repository contains png images files that aren\'t able to be indexed (we aren\'t using OCR), so I am going to optimize the indexing time slightly by excluding them. You can also exclude gif/jpg image files.\\n![Azure Portal - Cognitive Search - Create Search Indexer](/images/posts/AzurePortal_CognitiveSearch_CreateIndexer.png \\"Azure Portal - Cognitive Search - Create Search Indexer\\")\\n1. Finally, hit Submit to start the indexing process. *This could take a while, depending on the amount of data*\\n1. Leave this running in the background and navigate to the Cognitive Search resource, Overview pane to see the status.\\n![Azure Portal - Cognitive Search - Indexer](/images/posts/AzurePortal_CognitiveSearch_OverviewIndexer.png.png \\"Azure Portal - Cognitive Search - Indexer\\")\\n\\n*Note: You can also run the Import Data in Azure OpenAI Studio, which will trigger an index - but you need to keep your browser open and responsive. Depending on how much data you are indexing, doing it manually through this process could be preferred to avoid browser timeout. You also get more options around the index.*\\n\\n### Create Azure OpenAI\\n\\nNow that we have our base Azure resources, it\'s time to create Azure OpenAI.\\nMake sure your region and subscription have been approved for Azure OpenAI.\\n\\nRun the following PowerShell cmdlets to create the Azure OpenAI service:\\n\\nTo create the Azure OpenAI service, we will be using the Azure Portal.\\n\\n1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)\\n1. In the top center search bar, type in Azure OpenAI\\n1. In the Cognitive Services, [Azure OpenAI](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ProjectOxford/CognitiveServicesHub/~/OpenAI) section, click + Create\\n1. Select your subscription, region, name, and pricing tier of your Azure OpenAI service (remember certain [models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#model-summary-table-and-region-availability) are only available in specific regions - we need GPT 3.5+), then select Next\\n![Azure OpenAI - Create Resource](/images/posts/AzurePortal_AzureOpenAI_Create.png \\"Azure OpenAI - Create Resource\\")\\n1. Update your Network Configuration; for this demo, we will select \'All Networks\' - but the best practice is to restrict it. Click Next\\n![Azure OpenAI - Create Resource](/images/posts/AzurePortal_AzureOpenAI_CreateSelectNetwork.png \\"Azure OpenAI - Create Resource\\")\\n1. If you have any Tags, enter them, then click Next\\n1. The Azure platform will now validate your deployment (an example is ensuring that the Azure OpenAI has a unique name). Review the configuration, then click Create to create your resource.\\n![Azure OpenAI - Create Resource](/images/posts/AzurePortal_AzureOpenAI_CreateReview.png \\"Azure OpenAI - Create Resource\\")\\n\\nNow that the Azure OpenAI service has been created, you should now have the following:\\n\\n* An Azure OpenAI service\\n* A Storage account\\n* A Cognitive Search service\\n\\n![Azure OpenAI - RAG Deployed Resources](/images/posts/AzurePortal_AzureOpenAI_BYOD_Resources.png \\"Azure OpenAI - RAG Deployed Resources\\")\\n\\n### Deploy Model\\n\\nNow that we have our Azure OpenAI instance, it\'s time to deploy our Chat model.\\n\\n1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)\\n1. In the top center search bar, type in Azure OpenAI\\n1. Open your Azure OpenAI instance to the Overview page, and click: Go to Azure OpenAI Studio\\n1. Click on Models, and verify that you have gpt models *(ie, gpt-36-turbo, or gpt-4)*. If you don\'t, then make sure you have been [onboarded](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n1. Once verified, click on Deployments\\n1. Click on + Create new deployment\\n1. Select your model (I am going to go with gpt-35-turbo), type in a deployment name, and then click Create\\n1. Once deployment has been completed, you may have to wait up to 5 minutes for the Chat API to be aware of your new deployment.\\n\\n![Azure OpenAI - Deploy Model](/images/posts/Create_AzureOpenAI_GPT3.5_Deployment.gif \\"Azure OpenAI - Deploy Model\\")\\n\\n### Run Chat against your data\\n\\nFinally, it\'s time to query and work with our Azure documents.\\n\\nWe can do this using the Chat Playground, a feature of Azure OpenAI that allows us to work with our Chat models and adjust [prompts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/advanced-prompt-engineering?pivots=programming-language-chat-completions&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\nWe will not change the System Prompt (although to get the most out of your own data, I recommend giving it ago); the System Prompt will remain as: You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.\\n\\n1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)\\n1. In the top center search bar, type in Azure OpenAI\\n1. Open your Azure OpenAI instance to the Overview page, and click: Go to Azure OpenAI Studio\\n1. Click Chat\\n1. Click Add your data (preview) - if this doesn\'t show, ensure you have deployed a GPT model as part of the previous steps.\\n1. Click on + Add a data source\\n1. Select the dropdown list in the Select data source pane and select Azure Cognitive Search\\n1. Select your Cognitive Search service, created earlier\\n1. Select your Index\\n1. Check, I acknowledge that connecting to an Azure Cognitive Search account will incur usage to my account. [View Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/search/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n1. Click Next\\n1. It should bring in the index metadata; for example - our content data is mapped to content - so I will leave this as is; click Next\\n1. I am not utilizing Semantic search, so I click Next\\n1. Finally, review my settings and click Save and Close\\n1. Now we can verify our own data is getting checked by leaving the: Limit responses to your own data content checked\\n1. Then, in the Chat session, in the User message, I type: Tell me about Azure Elastic SAN?\\n1. It will now reference the Cognitive Search and bring in the data from the index, including references to the location where it found the data!\\n\\n![Azure OpenAI - Chat Playground](/images/posts/Query_AzureOpenAI_ChatPlayground_AzureDocs.gif \\"Azure OpenAI -Chat Playground\\")\\n\\n### Optional - Deploy to an Azure WebApp\\n\\nInteracting with our data in the Chat playground can be an enlightening experience, but we can go a step further and leverage the native tools to a chat interface - straight to an Azure web app.\\n\\nTo do this, we need to navigate back to the Chat playground, ensure you have added your own cognitive search, and can successfully retrieve data from your index.\\n\\n1. Click on Deploy to\\n1. Select A new web app...\\n1. If you have an existing WebApp, you can update it with an updated System Message or Search Index from the Chat playground settings, but we will: Create a new web app\\n1. Enter a suitable name (i.e., AI-WebApp-Tst - this needs to be unique)\\n1. Select the Subscription and Resource Group and location to deploy to. I had issues accessing my custom data, when deployed to Australia East (as AI services are in East US), so I will deploy in the same region as my OpenAI and Cognitive Search service - i.e., East US.\\n1. Specify a plan (i.e., Standard (S1))\\n1. Click Deploy\\n\\n![Azure OpenAI - Deploy](/images/posts/Deploy_AzureOpenAI_ChatPlayground_WebApp.gif \\"Azure OpenAI -Chat Playground\\")\\n\\nNote: Deployment may take up to 10 minutes to deploy; you can navigate to the Resource Group you are deploying to, select Deployments, and monitor the deployment. Once deployed, it can take another 10 minutes for authentication to be configured.\\n\\nNote: By default, the Azure WebApp is restricted to only be accessible by yourself; you can expand this out by adjusting the [authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/use-your-data-quickstart?tabs=command-line&pivots=programming-language-studio&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#important-considerations).\\n\\nOnce it is deployed, you can access the Chat interface, directly from an Azure WebApp!\\n\\n![Azure OpenAI - Run Azure WebApp](/images/posts/Run_AzureOpenAI_ChatPlayground_WebApp.gif \\"Azure OpenAI - Run Azure WebApp\\")\\n\\nIf you navigate to the WebApp resource in the Azure Portal, and look at the Configuration and Application Settings of your WebApp, you can see variables used as part of the deployment. You can adjust these, but be wary as it could break the WebApp, I would recommend redeploying/updating the WebApp for major changes, from Azure OpenAI studio.\\n![Azure OpenAI - App Service - App Settings](/images/posts/AzureOpenAI_AzureAppService_Deployment_AppSettings.png \\"Azure OpenAI -

Possessing the ability to pass through the\xa0shields\xa0of known ships it also functions (and has been used) as a devastating weapon to kill the entire crew of orbiting ships or wipe out all life on the surface of hundreds of planets at a time. \\"It is not only capable of destroying the Replicators but all life in the galaxy.\\"\\n\\n![Azure Dakara superweapon](/images/posts/CleanupyourUnwantedAzureResourcesonaSchedule.png \\"Azure Dakara superweapon\\")\\n\\nUsing the latest Windows PowerShell release - 7.2 (Preview), this script is built around the following capabilities:\\n\\n* **Delete ALL resource groups** (without a specific Tag) **under all subscriptions**, under a specific **Management Group**\\n* **Delete all resources** within those resource groups\\n* **Delete** Azure **Recovery Vaults** and their backed up items\\n* **Delete** any **Azure policy assignments**, assigned directly to any subscription under the Management Group\\n* **Delete** any Azure **RBAC role assignments**, assigned directly to any subscription under the Management Group.\\n\\nIn my demo environment, I have a range of Management Groups, and 2 Azure subscriptions.\\n\\n![Luke\'s Azure Management Group structure](/images/posts/VisualStudio_Luke_MG_Structure.png \\"Luke\'s Azure Management Group structure\\")\\\\`\\n\\nFor my purposes, I created a [System Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/automation/enable-managed-identity-for-automation?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Using a system-assigned managed identity for an Azure Automation account\\") from the Azure Automation account, and applied it to the: \'mg\' Management Group as \'Owner\' (Contributor will work, as long as you don\'t plan on removing the rights from the Azure subscriptions - theoretically, so could Contributor + User Access Administrator roles).\\n\\nAgain - this was created for my own environment - if you decide to run this, TEST IT! And Make sure it has as limited permissions as possible, potentially the Managed Identity will only have access to a specific test Subscription that you may not care about. I take no responsibily.\\n\\nThe System Identity will be used to execute the runbook.\\n\\nI also needed a Tag *(ie a Safe word)* to save the Resource Groups that I need to remain, an example is a project I am working on, demo etc. This Tag is in name only - as Tags are Key/Value pairs in Azure - in this case I only cared about the Key (ie NotDelete) - what was in the value, didn\'t matter.\\n\\n![NotDelete - Azure Tag](/images/posts/Initiate-DakaraSuperWeapon_SafeWord.png \\"NotDelete - Azure Tag\\")\\n\\nImportant: When importing the Runbook it is imperative that you Tag the Resource Group it is in, with your safe word!

Combining SAN-like capabilities with the benefits of being a cloud-native service, Azure Elastic SAN offers a massively scalable, cost-effective, high-performance, and resilient storage solution. It can connect to a variety of Azure compute services, enabling you to seamlessly transition your SAN data estate to the cloud without having to refactor your application architectures.\u201d\\n\\nAzure Elastic SAN provides a storage solution that is highly scalable, cost-effective, high-performing, and resilient. It caters to various storage needs, whether you\'re migrating your on-premises SAN to the cloud or creating your application directly in the cloud.\\n\\n> As Azure Elastic SAN is still in the preview stage, as of 28/05/2023, it is important to note that its [features\\n> and functionality](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/elastic-san/elastic-san-introduction?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#support-for-azure-storage-features) may change before it reaches production. Microsoft continues to actively gather feedback from users and refine the offering to ensure a seamless experience when it finally becomes\\n> generally available. Request access to the Preview by filling out this [form](https://aka.ms/AzureElasticSANPreviewAccess). This feature should not be used for production workloads until General Availability (GA).\\n\\n![Bytes, Blocks and Elasticity - Getting Started with Azure Elastic SAN](/images/posts/BytesBlocksAzureElasticSAN_Blog_Heading.gif \\"Bytes, Blocks and Elasticity - Getting Started with Azure Elastic SAN\\")\\n\\nA Storage Area Network (SAN) typically comprises one or more physical appliances equipped with multiple drive bays, which are used to create volumes \u2013 it is considered a high-performance and low-latency connectivity\\nstorage solution.\\n\\nThe benefits of a SAN are:\\n\\n* Grow storage footprint independent of Compute\\n* Low latency and high storage throughput\\n* Cost efficient with massive scale.\\n* Built for databases and IOPS-intensive applications.\\n* Supports large virtualization deployments.\\n\\nIntroducing [Azure Elastic SAN](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/elastic-san/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#overview).\\n\\n![Azure Elastic SAN - Overview](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN.PNG \\"Azure Elastic SAN - Overview\\")\\n\\nWith the Azure Elastic SAN, we can the elasticity of the Microsoft Azure block storage systems, to supply expandable block storage capabilities to workloads via [iSCSI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/elastic-san/elastic-san-planning?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#iscsi-support) (Internet Small Computer Systems Interface), or services such as Azure Kubernetes Services through [Azure Container Storage](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-storage-blog/azure-container-storage-in-public-preview/ba-p/3819246?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\nWhen looking at some of the [benefits](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/elastic-san/elastic-san-introduction?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#benefits-of-elastic-san) of an Azure Elastic SAN, over a traditional SAN, we will delve into several\\ncommon user stories around SAN provisioning and capacity management, with key differences around time to deployment and skills required.\\n\\n![Azure Elastic SAN - User journey](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_UserJourney.PNG \\"Azure Elastic SAN - User journey\\")\\n\\n#### Architecture and Components\\n\\nThe Azure Elastic SAN consists of 3 layers:\\n\\n![Azure Elastic SAN - Overview](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_3Layers.PNG \\"Azure Elastic SAN - Overview\\")\\n\\n##### The Elastic SAN\\n\\nThe Elastic SAN itself, the Elastic SAN consists of the control plane, where you create and manage your Volume Groups from. The Elastic SAN is where the resources are provisioned, and the Cost Management takes place (i.e., Tags on the Elastic SAN resource).\\n\\n##### Volume Group\\n\\nAn Azure Elastic SAN can have up to 20 volume groups, the volume group is where your security, encryption, and data protection configurations get applied.\\n\\nThe volume group is where your Network Security rule and service endpoints are applied. Any settings or configurations applied to a volume group, such as virtual network rules, are inherited by any volumes associated with that volume group.\\n\\n![Azure Elastic SAN - Volume Group Network Security Rules](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_VolumeGroup_NetworkSecurityRule.PNG \\"Azure Elastic SAN - Volume Group Network Security Rules\\")\\n\\n##### Volume\\n\\nThe volume in an Azure Elastic SAN is the actual storage, that gets delivered and mapped to your workload or service.\\n\\nMultiple volumes can be a part of a single-volume group, or separate groups \u2013 depending on requirements, such as accessibility across different virtual networks.\\n\\n![Azure Elastic SAN - Volume](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_Volume.PNG \\"Azure Elastic SAN - Volume\\")\\n\\nYou partition the SAN\'s storage capacity into individual volumes. These individual volumes can be mounted to your clients with iSCSI. The name of your volume is part of their iSCSI IQD\\n\\n![Azure Elastic SAN - Volume](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_Volume2.PNG \\"Azure Elastic SAN - Volume\\")\\n\\n#### Deployment and Configuration\\n\\nNow that we know what Azure Elastic SAN is, let\'s deploy it using the Azure Portal.\\n\\nAt the time of this article, the Azure Elastic SAN is only available in [specific regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/regional-expansion-azure-elastic-san-public-preview-is-now-available-in-more-regions/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) \u2013 and whether the SAN is capable of ZRS or LRS [storage redundancy](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796). As I am based in New Zealand, the closest region at this time to me is Australia East, this region only supports LRS so this is what I will be configuring.\\n\\nIf you haven\u2019t already \u2013 as part of Public Preview, your Azure subscription needs to be [enabled](https://aka.ms/AzureElasticSANPreviewAccess) to provision Azure Elastic SAN.\\n\\n##### Deployment\\n\\n1. Login to the Microsoft Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com/)\\n2. In the search box at the top of the portal, type in Elastic SAN, and navigate to the [Elastic SAN](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.ElasticSan%2Felasticsans) resource page.\\n3. Click Create Elastic SAN\\n4. ![Create Azure Elastic SAN using the Azure Portal](/images/posts/Create-Portal-AzElasticSAN.png \\"Create Azure Elastic SAN using the Azure Portal\\")\\n5. I will create a new Resource Group named: AzureElasticSAN-dev-rg\\n6. I will name my Azure Elastic SAN: azelasticsan_aue\\n   (Name has to be between 3 to 24 characters in length, and may only contain\\n   lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores (hyphens and underscores\\n   must be surrounded by letters or numbers).\\n7. ![Create an Azure Elastic SAN](/images/posts/Create-Portal-AzElasticSAN-Redunancy.png \\"Create an Azure Elastic SAN\\")\\n8. Now we need to specify the base and capacity size, the base size will determine what your iOPS and throughput your SAN will support. It\u2019s cheaper to go with, a lower Base size, and higher additional storage \u2013 but it will affect your IOPS and bandwidth. These values can be changed later (start with a minimum and increase as needed, as you can\u2019t downsize) \u2013 I will set my Base as the minimum of 1 TB and add size of 1TB.\\n9. ![Create Azure Elastic SAN - Resource Provisioning](/images/posts/Create-Portal-AzElasticSAN-ResourceProvisioning.png \\"Create Azure Elastic SAN - Resource Provisioning\\")\\n10. Click Next\\n11. This is where we can create a volume group, click + Create volume group\\n12. The volume group will be used to contain our volumes, I will name a volume group as demo\\n13. I will then allow the volume group, to connect to my DevBox virtual network and set up a service endpoint, on my devbox subnet\\n14. ![Create an Azure Elastic SAN - Volume Group](/images/posts/Create-Portal-AzElasticSAN-AddVolumeGrpVNET.png \\"Create an Azure Elastic SAN - Volume Group\\")\xa0\\n15. Click Create, and finally Review + Create to create your Azure Elastic SAN.\\n16. Configuration\\n\\nNow that we have an Azure Elastic SAN, it\u2019s now time to add some volumes. We can partition the SAN\'s total storage into individual volumes, used for block storage.\\n\\nA volume can only be part of one volume group, but you can have multiple volumes, across multiple volume groups \u2013 that equals the total size of the SAN (in my example 2 TB, the 1 TB Base size, and 1 TB additional capacity), however unlike the SAN \u2013 a volume can be Gigabytes in size.\\n\\nA volume cannot be higher than the total allocated capacity assigned to the SAN.\\n\\nRemember when you create a new Volume, you can increase the size later (but you can\u2019t downsize the volume).\\n\\nThe volume name is part of your volume\'s iSCSI Qualified Name and can\'t be changed once deployed.\\n\\n![Azure Elastic SAN - Overview](/images/posts/Create-Portal-AzElasticSAN-Overview.png \\"Azure Elastic SAN - Overview\\")\\n\\n1. To create a new Volume, let\'s navigate to our [Azure Elastic SAN](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.ElasticSan%2Felasticsans).\\n2. Click on Volumes (under SAN Management)\\n3. Click Create a volume.\\n4. We are going to give the volume a name, in this example I will go with: vol1\\n5. For the size, I will select 500GB.\\n6. Click Save\\n7. Once the volume has been created, we can see the volume and the assigned volume group, including the size of the volume and the remaining capacity of the SAN.\\n\\n##### Connect\\n\\nNow that the SAN, Volume Group, and Volume have been setup \u2013 it\u2019s time to connect to the storage.\\n\\nIn my demo environment, I have a Volume Group, assigned to a storage service endpoint on my devbox virtual network and subnet, so I will connect to the SAN through a Windows Server 2022 server, that is attached to the same virtual network.\\n\\n> Following this guide will set up a single path, for more production scenarios to achieve higher IOPS and throughput, and configure mulipathing using the Microsoft document \u2018[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/elastic-san/elastic-san-connect-windows?tabs=azure-portal\\\\&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#connect-to-a-volume)\u2019.\\n\\n1. To connect, we need to navigate to our volume, lets navigate to our [Azure Elastic SAN](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.ElasticSan%2Felasticsans).\\n2. Click Volumes\\n3. Click your volume, you want to connect to and select Connect.\\n4. Microsoft Azure, gives us the PowerShell/Bash cmdlets to run on Windows and Linux. Copy the scripts, we will need to run both.\\n5. Login to your Windows Server that you want to\\n   connect to the volume. If this is a new Windows Server, that hasn\u2019t been configured to iSCSI \u2013 you will need to [start the iSCSI Initiator service and set it to Automatic start.](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/PowerOfTheShell/blob/master/Other/Start-iSCSI.ps1)\\n6. Open a PowerShell prompt as Administrator and run the Add Target command, you should have \u2018Operation completed successfully\u2019.\\n7. Then run the login to target script.\\n8. ![Connect Windows Server to iSCSI ](/images/posts/Run_iSCSI_AzElasticSANConnect.gif \\"Connect Windows Server to iSCSI \\")\\n9. Once completed, you can confirm your connectivity, by opening up Server Manager and launching iSCSI Initiator, you should see \'Connected\'.\\n10. ![Azure iSCSI initiator](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_SingleThreaded_iSCSI_Initiator.png \\"Azure iSCSI initiator\\")\\n11. Now that your iSCSI target has been mapped \u2013 lets create a volume we can actually use!\\n12. Right Click your Start Menu and click Disk Management\\n13. You should see an Unallocated Disk\\n14. ![Azure Elastic SAN - Disk Management](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_DiskManagement_Unallocated.png \\"Azure Elastic SAN - Disk Management\\")\\n15. The unallocated disk here, is our 500GB Azure Elastic SAN volume, it\u2019s time to initialize it, right click and select Create New Simple Volume, I will go through the defaults and now I have a new drive I can use within Windows\\n16. ![Azure Elastic SAN - Windows mounted volume](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_WindowsExplorer_Allocated.png \\"Azure Elastic SAN - Windows mounted volume\\")\\n\\n#### Scalability and Performance\\n\\nNow that we have provisioned the Azure Elastic SAN, and connected to it, let\u2019s take a high-level look at the scalability and performance.\\n\\nFor performance, I ran a single threaded test on my 500GB iSCSI target using [Diskspd](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure-stack/hci/manage/diskspd-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), using the following parameters:\\n\\n```bat\\n.\\\\diskspd.exe - d60 - W15 - C15 - c128M - t4 - o4 - b8k - L - r - Sh - w50 f: \\\\disk - speed - test.dat\\n```\\n\\nThe output was:\\n\\nTotal IO:\\n\\n* I/Os: 109,541\\n* I/O per second: 1,825.30\\n\\nRead IO:\\n\\n* I/Os: 54,547\\n* I/O per second: 908.93\\n\\nWrite IO:\\n\\n* I/Os: 54,994\\n* I/O per second: 916.38\\n\\nThe output does not directly provide the exact IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) value, but we can calculate it based on the total number of I/Os and the test duration.\\n\\nTo calculate the overall IOPS, divide the total number of I/Os by the test duration:\\n\\n* Total IOPS: 109,541 I/Os / 60 seconds = 1,825.68 IOPS\\n\\nSimilarly, you can calculate the read and write IOPS:\\n\\n* Read\\n  IOPS: 54,547 I/Os / 60 seconds = 909.12 IOPS\\n* Write\\n  IOPS: 54,994 I/Os / 60 seconds = 916.57 IOPS\\n\\nTherefore, based on the given Diskspd output, the SAN is performing approximately 1,825 IOPS in total, with 909 IOPS for reads and 917 IOPS for writes.\\n\\nNote: This was a very basic test, running on a Windows Server 2022 Azure Virtual Machine (Standard D4s v3 (4 vcpus, 16 GiB memory)), single threaded.\\n\\nAt the time I ran this test \u2013 the IOPS limit of the SAN was 5000, and bandwidth was 80. I highly encourage you to run your own tests. This was more intended as a baseline for reference.\\n\\n![Azure Elastic SAN - storage throughput](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_StorageThroughput.PNG \\"Azure Elastic SAN - storage throughput\\")\\n\\nPathping, reported 0 hops for DNS resolution, this Virtual Machine is in another Availability Zone from the SAN.\\n\\n![Azure Elastic SAN - Pathping](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_Pathping.png \\"Azure Elastic SAN - Pathping\\")\\n\\nIn terms of Scalability, a few things to note:\\n\\n* You cannot increase the volume size, while an active session (i.e., in use by a workload) is in use.\\n* You can increase the Base and Additional size of the SAN, while sessions are in use.\\n* The Additional size of the Azure Elastic SAN has to be less than the Base size (for example, you cannot have an Azure Elastic SAN with a Base size of 3, and an Additional size of 4).\\n\\n#### Data Protection and Redundancy\\n\\nAt the moment, Azure Elastic SAN, only supports specific regions and [configurations](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), for example in Australia East, the Azure Elastic SAN only supports LRS, so the volumes sit within a single datacenter, replicated across 3 storage stacks.\\n\\n![LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)](/images/posts/locally-redundant-storage.png \\"LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)\\")\\n\\nLRS is still decent in terms of resiliency but for those who are use to cross SAN replication - I expect, we will see ZRS start to become common place, as this service is rolled out.\\n\\n![ZRS (Zone Redundant Storage)](/images/posts/zone-redundant-storage.png \\"ZRS (Zone Redundant Storage)\\")\\n\\nAt the time of this writing, there is no Azure Backup  Support, I expect this capacity to be released closer to GA (Generally Available).\\nFor day to day operations, I was able to enable the [Volume Shadow Copies](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), which allowed me to go back to  previous versions of files and folders.\\n\\n#### Security and Compliance\\n\\nOther than the usual filesystem permissions, you can use with your filesystems across Windows and Linux on the Azure Elastic SAN, there are built-in roles that can be leveraged for Azure Elastic SAN management.\\n\\nAssigning least privilege operations or creating your own custom role is possible with Azure Elastic SAN, and roles such as Volume Group Owner will be key to how the SAN is architectured for an organisation.\\n\\n| **Name**                           | **Description**                                                                                                                                             |\\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Elastic SAN Owner              | Allows for full access to all resources under Azure Elastic SAN including changing network security policies to unblock data path access.               |\\n| Elastic SAN Reader             | Allows for control path read access to Azure Elastic SAN                                                                                                |\\n| Elastic SAN Volume Group Owner | \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Allows for full access to a volume group in Azure Elastic SAN including changing network security policies to unblock data path access. |\\n\\nAll data stored in an Elastic SAN is encrypted at rest using Azure storage service encryption (SSE). Storage service encryption works similarly to BitLocker on Windows: data is encrypted beneath the file system level. SSE protects your data and to helps you meet your organizational security and compliance commitments. Data stored in Elastic SAN is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys, that are rotated frequently.\\n\\n#### Integration with Azure Services\\n\\nAt the moment, Azure Elastic SAN supports, Service Endpoints only, [Private endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) are not yet available, but enabling service endpoints on subnet/s was easily done. \\n\\nConnectivity to Windows and Linux machines, will be done through native iSCSI protocols, as the Azure Portal displayed when attempting to connect.\\n\\nAt the time of this writing, [Azure Container Storage](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-storage-blog/azure-container-storage-in-public-preview/ba-p/3819246?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) \u2013 connecting to Azure Kubernetes Service, can be leveraged by Azure Elastic SAN (Azure Container Storage is also in Public Preview).\\n\\n![Azure Elastic SAN - Azure services integration](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_ComputeIntegration.PNG \\"Azure Elastic SAN - Azure services integration\\")\\n\\n#### Cost and Pricing\\n\\nThe Azure Elastic SAN is [charged by the amount you provision based on units](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/elastic-san/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796):  \\n\\n* Base unit\\n* Capacity-only unit\\n\\nThey are designed to offer a simple bulk provisioning experience while also providing flexibility to expand your data footprint.\\n\\nThe Base unit has a capacity of 5000 IOPs and a throughput of 80 MBps per TiB.\\n\\nThe Capacity only unit, on the other hand, allows you to provision capacity only without provisioning performance at a lower cost.\\n\\nAs a result, you can cost-effectively scale performance while migrating workloads from on-premises to Azure.\\n\\nThe total price of Azure Elastic SAN depends on the base and capacity scale unit (LRS and ZRS dependent).\\n\\nElastic SAN will need to be provisioned with at least one base unit of 1TiB. It is also important to note that the SAN-provisioned resources are shared by all volume groups and volumes.\\n\\n![Azure Elastic SAN - Provisioning Model](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_ProvisioningModel.PNG \\"Azure Elastic SAN - Provisioning Model\\")\\n\\n![Azure Elastic SAN - Cost Management](/images/posts/AzureElasticSAN_CostManagement.PNG)\\n\\n#### Tips\\n\\nI will cover a few titbits, I found in my discovery.  \\n\\n* Authentication Failure \u2013 if you get \u2018Authentication\\n   Failure\u2019, when attempting to connect to your iSCSI target (Azure Elastic SAN Volume), from your Windows or Linux workload, make sure that the Volume Group has had the Service Endpoint enabled for the subnet and virtual network you are connecting from, by default all traffic is denied to the Azure Elastic SAN \u2013 this includes traffic from other subnets, the storage endpoint needs to be enabled on the subnet that hosts your virtual machines.\\n* Persistent Login - When connecting to the iSCSI target (the Volume) this is a once off session, if your system is rebooted, the volume won\u2019t automatically remap. You can set a Persistent Login, by replacing \u2018LoginTarget\u2019\\n   in your iscsicli command to: PersistentLoginTarget (for example: iscsicli PersistentLoginTarget iqn.2023-05.net.windows.core.blob.ElasticSan.es-rsip05eo4sx0:vol1 t es-rsip05eo4sx0.z40.blob.storage.azure.net 3260 Root\\\\ISCSIPRT\\\\0000\\\\_0 -1 \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* \\\\* 0), then the next time you reboot your Windows server, the volume will be automatically mounted.\\n\\n#### Updates and New Features\\n\\nAs this is a Private Preview service, there will be updates on functionality and features that I have gone through today and may have missed.\\n\\n* [aka.ms/ElasticSANOverview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/elastic-san/elastic-san-introduction?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [aka.ms/ElasticSANPlanning](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/elastic-san/elastic-san-planning?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [aka.ms/ElasticSANPricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/elastic-san/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* Keep an eye out on the [Azure Updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?query=SAN\\\\&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) page for updates.\\n* Or if you are Linkedin member, follow [Azure Feeds](https://www.linkedin.com/in/azure-feeds-709457212/recent-activity/all/ \\"Azure Feeds\\") on Linkedin."},{"id":"azure/Demystifying-Azure-Policy-Inheritance-Understanding-the-Hierarchy-of-Control","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/Demystifying-Azure-Policy-Inheritance-Understanding-the-Hierarchy-of-Control","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-17-Demystifying-Azure-Policy-Inheritance-Understanding-the-Hierarchy-of-Control.md","title":"Azure Policy Inheritance","description":"Look into Azure Policy inheritance and how it works.","date":"2023-05-16T12:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":3.975,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Azure Policy Inheritance","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"description":"Look into Azure Policy inheritance and how it works.","header":{"teaser":"/images/posts/AzurePolicy_Effects.png"},"date":"2023-05-16T12:00:00.000Z","slug":"azure/Demystifying-Azure-Policy-Inheritance-Understanding-the-Hierarchy-of-Control"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Getting Started with Azure Elastic SAN","permalink":"/azure/Bytes-Blocks-and-Elasticity-Getting-Started-with-Azure-Elastic-SAN"},"nextItem":{"title":"Web Content Not Found on Azure Storage Account","permalink":"/azure/Web-Content-Not-Found-error-on-Azure-Storage-Account-static-website"}},"content":"Today, we are going to look into demystifying Azure Policy inheritance and how it works, so let\u2019s do some testing.\\n\\nIn my tests \u2013 I have a single resource group named: AzPolicy-Test. This resource group has been placed in the Australia East region.\\n\\nNow that we have a Resource Group to use in our testing, I need a policy \u2013 to keep things simple, I am going use the built-in policy of: [AllowedLocations](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyadvertizer/e56962a6-4747-49cd-b67b-bf8b01975c4c.html). This policy will allow us to control which region we can deploy our Azure resources into.\\n\\n##### **Scenario #1 \u2013 Policy assigned to the subscription with Allow Australia East ONLY**\\n\\nI have assigned my Azure Policy to a Subscription, that contains my AzPolicy-Test Resource Group. I have set the Allowed Locations to: Australia East.\\n\\n![Azure Policy - Allowed locations](/images/posts/AzurePolicy-AllowedLocations-DenyAllAustraliaE.png \\"Azure Policy - Allowed locations\\")\\n\\nLet us do some testing, and try to deploy an Azure Resource _(in my example, an Azure Storage account)_ into my Resource Group:\\n\\n| Can I deploy to Australia East? | Yes |\\n| ------------------------------- | --- |\\n| Can I deploy to UK South?       | No  |\\n\\nAs you can see my storage account deployed into Australia East successfully\u2026 as expected!\\n\\n![Azure Portal - filtered by location](/images/posts/AzurePolicy-FilterLocations_AustraliaEast.png \\"Azure Portal - filtered by location\\")\\n\\nNow, lets try and deploy a Storage account into the same Resource Group, but in the UK South region.\\n\\nAs Azure Resource Manager is analysing and verifying the inputs give it \u2013 it now knows there is an Azure Policy \u2013 enforcing specific locations and preventing my deployment into the UK South.\\n\\n![Azure Storage Account - Deny UK South deployment](/images/posts/AzurePolicy_DenyUKSouth.png \\"Azure Storage Account - Deny UK South deployment\\")\\n\\nThis is as expected, and even if I were to use another resource group \u2013 I still won\u2019t be able to create resources in other regions.\\n\\n##### **Scenario #2 \u2013 Policy assigned to the subscription with Allow Australia East but another policy with Allow UK South only on the Resource Group**\\n\\nNow that we know, we can create resources in Australia East \u2013 lets assign the same \u2018Allowed Locations\u2019 policy to the Resource Group, but Denying Australia East, and Allowing UK South. The policy allowing Australia East will still remain assigned to the subscription.\\n\\n![Azure Policy - Allowed locations - UK South](/images/posts/AzurePolicy-AllowedLocation_UkSouth.png \\"Azure Policy - Allowed locations - UK South\\")\\n\\nLet us do some testing, and try to deploy an Azure Resource (in my example, an Azure Storage account) into my Resource Group:\\n\\n| Can I deploy to Australia East? | No |\\n| ------------------------------- | -- |\\n| Can I deploy to UK South?       | No |\\n\\n![Azure Storage account deployment - Policy validation error](/images/posts/AzurePolicy-DisableUKSouthDeployment.png \\"Azure Storage account deployment - Policy validation error\\")\\n\\n![Azure Storage account deployment - Policy validation error](/images/posts/AzurePolicy-DisableAustraliaEastDeployment.png \\"Azure Storage account deployment - Policy validation error\\")\\n\\nI can\u2019t deploy to either UK South or Australia East, even though I have 2 separate policies, one policy allowing Australia East (deployed at the subscription) and one policy allowing UK South _(deployed at the Resource Group)_.\\n\\nIn this case, the policies have worked together, with the most restrictive of them both in effect \u2013 which is Deny.\\n\\n##### **Review**\\n\\nSo lets review, originally you might think that like Group Policy \u2013 the last policy wins \u2013 this is not always the case, when conflicting policies are assigned at different levels, the policy at the highest level in the hierarchy takes precedence over policies at lower levels. When preforming a Modify or Create on a resource \u2013 the Azure resource provider checks with the Azure Policy engine.. When deciding what policy to take the Azure Policy engine, will analyze all policies together (like the above scenarius, where both deployment to UK South and Australia East were in effect - however the most restrictive won).\\n\\nThere are, however, various effects which are analysed first.\\n\\n![Azure Policy Effects](/images/posts/AzurePolicy_Effects.png \\"Azure Policy Effects\\")\\n\\n1. **Disabled** is checked first to determine whether the policy rule should be evaluated.\\n2. **Append** and **Modify** are then evaluated. Since either could alter the request, a change made may prevent an audit or deny effect from triggering.

It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machines directly from the Azure portal over TLS.\\n\\nBecause of this, if you don\'t have line-of-sight access to your Virtual Machines (_via express route, Site-to-Site VPN etc.)_, Bastion becomes your jump box, allowing secure access to your virtual machines without needing a public IP.\\n\\nThere is a downside, though. To connect to a Virtual Machine secured by Bastion, you need access to the Azure Portal, or command line connectivity to Azure, to create the tunnel; this means that you may need to grant people elevated rights and access they may not need to connect.\\n\\nAs of November 2022, Microsoft introduced shareable links into public preview, solving two key pain points:\\n\\n* Administrators will no longer have to provide full access to their Azure accounts to one-time VM users\u2014helping to maintain their privacy and security.\\n* Users without Azure subscriptions can seamlessly connect to VMs without exposing RDP/SSH ports to the public internet.\\n\\n> The Bastion **Shareable Link** feature lets users connect to a target resource (virtual machine or virtual machine scale set) using Azure Bastion without accessing the Azure portal.\\n\\nAt the time of this writing, there are some [scenarios](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/shareable-link?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#considerations \\"Create a shareable link for Bastion\\") where shareable links won\'t work - particularly across Network peering across subscriptions and regions.\\n\\nBecause the service is in Public Preview - native PowerShell cmdlet support, enabling and configuring this feature isn\'t available - but you can easily allow it via the [Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/shareable-link?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#enable-shareable-link-feature \\"Enable Shareable Link feature\\").\\n\\n![Create Azure Bastion with Shareable Link Support](/uploads/azurebastion_shareablelinkheader.png \\"Create Azure Bastion with Shareable Link Support\\")\\n\\nTo get around that, we will leverage the [Azure Rest API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/azure/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure REST API reference\\") directly, using PowerShell to enable the Shareable Link feature and create and obtain a shareable link for a Virtual Machine.\\n\\n#### Create Azure Bastion\\n\\nI will assume there is already an Azure Virtual Network created; if not, you can follow the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/quick-create-portal?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Quickstart: Create a virtual network using the Azure portal\\") to get it up and running!\\n\\nAlso, make sure you have the [Az Module](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az?view=azps-9.5.0&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Introducing the Azure Az PowerShell module\\") installed.\\n\\nThe PowerShell function we will run will require a few parameters to create the Azure Bastion resource and enable Shared Link functionality; these parameters are:\\n\\n|  |  |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Parameters | Note |\\n| RGName | The Resource Group of your Virtual Network |\\n| VNetName | The Virtual Network name |\\n| addressPrefix | The address prefix for your new Bastion subnet.

These tools enable proactive communication regarding expenses and support the management of costs by closely monitoring spending trends over extended periods.\\n>\\n> One can set up alerts based on current or projected expenditures to maintain adherence to the established organizational spending limit. Upon surpassing the budget thresholds, notifications are promptly triggered. Such occurrences neither impact any of the available resources nor interrupt any consumption processes.\\n>\\n> By leveraging budgets, it becomes possible to perform detailed cost analysis and track expenses effectively.\\n\\n![Azure Back to School - Azure Budget Filters](/uploads/AzureSpringClean_AzureBudgets.png \\"Azure Spring Clean - Azure Budget Filters\\")\\n\\nBe aware of the delay with the Cost & Usage data, as there may be a difference between what you end up seeing in the Portal and the Budget itself - so make sure you account for this to be advised as early as possible:\\n\\n> Cost and usage data is typically available within 8-24 hours and budgets are evaluated against these costs every 24 hours.\\n>\\n> Be sure to get familiar with [Cost and usage data update](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/understand-cost-mgt-data?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#cost-and-usage-data-updates-and-retention \\"Cost and usage data updates and retention\\") specifics. When a budget threshold is met, email notifications are normally sent within an hour of the evaluation.\\n\\nNote: Azure Budgets are not supported on Subscriptions, where you can\'t access Microsoft Cost Management, i.e. [Azure Sponsorship](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/ \\"Azure Sponsorship\\") subscriptions.\\n\\n##### A time to clean the windows - Budget Scopes\\n\\nWhen creating an Azure Budget, you can specify a Scope. A scope is the level of your hierarchy _(i.e., if it\'s a Resource Group Budget, it cannot report on resources at the Subscription, you would have to create a Subscription or Management Group scoped Budget)._\\n\\nWhen you create an Azure Budget, they can be made at the following Scopes:\\n\\n![Microsoft Azure Budget Scopes](/uploads/azurebudget_scope.png \\"Microsoft Azure Budget Scopes\\")\\n\\nMost people, when creating scopes, will create a Scope at the Subscription and/or Resource Group level - there is no right or wrong answer when it comes to your Azure Budget Scope - this needs to work for you and your organisation, ie if you have a Project per Resource Group - then it would make sense to create a Budget per Resource Group, the same for Subscriptions.\\n\\n**You can also have multiple Azure Budgets** at the same or different scopes, so a **combination of Budgets may be the most effective**. An example could be a Subscription Budget that may go to a Product Owner, but a Management Group could go to Finance or the Technology teams.\\n\\nKeep in mind, that Budgets on their own are just a forecasting and alerting tool, they won\'t stop resources from running, if it goes over an alert threshold, out of the box - the Budget doesn\'t touch your resources, merely gives you an opportunity to proactively react to them, before costs become a problem.\\n\\n##### Time to scrum the floor - Create an Azure Budget\\n\\nLet\'s go through the process of creating an Azure Budget, using the Azure Portal.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. In the Search bar above, search for **Budgets**\\n 3. Click on **Budgets**\\n 4. **Change** the **Scope**\\n 5. ![Cost Management - Azure Budget](/uploads/azureportal_costmanagement_root.png \\"Cost Management - Azure Budget\\")\\n 6. You can select a Management Group, Subscription, or Resource Group for the Scope, by clicking on each - in my example, I have a Management Group named: _mg-landingzones_, which I am going to select.\\n 7. Click **Select**\\n 8. Now that the Scope has been set, we can add our Budget to the specified Scope, click **+ Add**\\n 9. We will come back to Filters, in another section - but for the Budget details you will need:\\n    * **Name** this is the name of your Budget, make sure its something meaningful _(ie Monthly-Budget_MG-LandingZones)_\\n    * **Reset period** _(Monthly/Quarterly or Annual, this is the period that the Budget resets back to $0 - you can\'t go wrong with Monthly)_\\n    * **Creation date** _(the date that the Budget will start)_\\n    * **Expiration date** _(the date that the Budget will stop)_\\n10. **Budget Amount**_(this is the overall; amount that you are planning on your resources to spend)_\\n11. ![Azure Portal - Create budget](/uploads/azureportal_createbudget_scoping.png \\"Azure Portal - Create budget\\")\\n12. Once you have entered in your Budget details, click Next to configure your Alert conditions. The alert conditions are where you can specify, what you want to alert on ie 50% or 80% of the overall budget amount. Actual - is when it financially reaches that point and Forecasted - is when current consumption is forecasted to reach that budget.\\n13. Specify an email address to send the Alert to and click **Create**.\\n14. ![Azure Budget Conditions](/uploads/azureportal_createbudget_conditions.png \\"Azure Budget Conditions\\")\\n\\n#### Time to clean the dishes - Azure Budget Filters\\n\\nBy default, Scoping the Budget to the Subscription or Resource Group is good enough for 95% of the use cases - but using Budget filters, you can enable a bit more flexibility - for scenarios such as:\\n\\n* Product-centric alerts\\n* Service centric alerts\\n\\nWhile the scope is your level of the Azure hierarchy, your filter is your handrail to stop you from falling, currently, Microsoft offers the following filters:\\n\\n| Property | When to use | Notes |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Availability zones | Break down AWS costs by availability zone. | Applicable only to AWS scopes and management groups. Azure data doesn\'t include availability zone and will show as\xa0No availability zone. |\\n| Billing period | Break down PAYG costs by the month that they were, or will be, invoiced. | Use\xa0Billing period\xa0to get a precise representation of invoiced PAYG charges. Include two extra days before and after the billing period if filtering down to a custom date range. Limiting to the exact billing period dates won\'t match the invoice. Will show costs from all invoices in the billing period. Use\xa0Invoice ID\xa0to filter down to a specific invoice. Applicable only to PAYG subscriptions because EA and MCA are billed by calendar months. EA/MCA accounts can use calendar months in the date picker or monthly granularity to accomplish the same goal. |\\n| BillingProfileId | The ID of the billing profile that is billed for the subscription\'s charges. | Unique identifier of the EA enrollment, pay-as-you-go subscription, MCA billing profile, or AWS consolidated account. |\\n| BillingProfileName | Name of the EA enrollment, pay-as-you-go subscription, MCA billing profile, or AWS consolidated account. | Name of the EA enrollment, pay-as-you-go subscription, MCA billing profile, or AWS consolidated account. |\\n| Charge type | Break down usage, purchase, refund, and unused reservation and savings plan costs. | Reservation purchases, savings plan purchases, and refunds are available only when using actual costs and not when using amortized costs. Unused reservation and savings plan costs are available only when looking at amortized costs. |\\n| Department | Break down costs by EA department. | Available only for EA and management groups. PAYG subscriptions don\'t have a department and will show as\xa0No department\xa0or\xa0unassigned. |\\n| Enrollment account | Break down costs by EA account owner. | Available only for EA billing accounts, departments, and management groups. PAYG subscriptions don\'t have EA enrollment accounts and will show as\xa0No enrollment account\xa0or\xa0unassigned. |\\n| Frequency | Break down usage-based, one-time, and recurring costs. | Indicates whether a charge is expected to repeat. Charges can either happen once\xa0OneTime, repeat on a monthly or yearly basis\xa0Recurring, or be based on usage\xa0UsageBased. |\\n| Invoice ID | Break down costs by billed invoice. | Unbilled charges don\'t have an invoice ID yet and EA costs don\'t include invoice details and will show as\xa0No invoice ID. |\\n| InvoiceSectionId | Unique identifier for the MCA invoice section. | Unique identifier for the EA department or MCA invoice section. |\\n| InvoiceSectionName | Name of the invoice section. | Name of the EA department or MCA invoice section. |\\n| Location | Break down costs by resource location or region. | Purchases and Marketplace usage may be shown as\xa0unassigned, or\xa0No resource location. |\\n| Meter | Break down costs by usage meter. | Purchases and Marketplace usage will show as\xa0unassigned\xa0or\xa0No meter.

At a high level, these zones consist of 3 separate data centres with independent cooling, power, switching etc.\\n\\n![Azure availability zones](/uploads/availability-zones.png \\"Azure availability zones\\")\\n\\n> Azure availability zones are connected by a high-performance network with a round-trip latency of less than 2ms. They help your data stay synchronized and accessible when things go wrong. Each zone is composed of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. Availability zones are designed so that if one zone is affected, regional services, capacity, and high availability are supported by the remaining two zones.\\n>\\n> With availability zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically transition between zones without interruption. Azure availability zones are highly available, fault tolerant, and more scalable than traditional single or multiple datacenter infrastructures.\\n\\n#### Availability Zone peering\\n\\nToday we are going to look into Availability Zone peering:\\n\\n> Each data centre is assigned to a physical zone. Physical zones are mapped to logical zones in your Azure subscription. Azure subscriptions are automatically assigned this mapping when a subscription is created.\\n\\n##### Physical Zones vs Logical Zones\\n\\nThere are a few things to be aware of here that I will call out:\\n\\n* **Physical zones** are mapped to **logical zones** in your Azure subscription.\\n* Azure subscriptions are automatically **assigned** this **mapping** **when** a **subscription** is **created**.\\n\\n**So what does this mean?**\\n\\nWe know we have three separate data centres within a single region:\\n\\n| Zone | Region |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Australia East |\\n| 2 | Australia East |\\n| 3 | Australia East |\\n\\nWe can see these zones in the Azure Portal when we create resources:\\n\\n![Azure Avalibility Zone - Selection](/uploads/avalibilityzone_selection_azportal.png \\"Azure Avalibility Zone - Selection\\")\\n\\nThis is great for making your solutions redundant against a single data centre failure and spreading your workloads across different zones; services such as Virtual Networks are zone-redundant by default, allowing access to resources across multiple zones out of the box.\\n\\nOne reason you may have all your resources in a single zone could be latency.\\n\\nLets us go back to the paragraphs around physical and logical zones and mapping - what does this mean?\\n\\nWhat this means is that each of the three data centres is assigned a physical **AND** logical mapping, so your Azure datacentres look like this:\\n\\n| Zone (Physical) | Region | Zone (Logical) |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1 | Australia East | 3 |\\n| 2 | Australia East | 2 |\\n| 3 | Australia East | 1 |\\n\\nWhen you **deploy a resource into an Azure Avalibility Zone and select Zone 1**, you choose **the Logical Zone, NOT** a **physical zone**.\\n\\nThis means that **FOR EACH** Microsoft **Azure subscription,** whether in the same Microsoft Entra ID tenancy or not, **Zone 1** can be a **different physical data centre**.\\n\\nSo if you have resources deployed across multiple subscriptions, and all your resources are deployed to Zone 1 - they **MAY NOT** be in the same physical data centre.\\n\\n| Azure Subscriptions | Region | Zone (Logical) | Zone (Physical) |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Sub A | Australia East | 1 | 1 |\\n| Sub B | Australia East | 1 | 3 |\\n| Sub B | Australia East | 1 | 1 |\\n\\nIn an example like the above, you have three separate Azure subscriptions, and you have deployed your Virtual Machines and other resources across all Azure subscriptions into Zone 1, 2 of your subscriptions are using the same physical zone for zone 1, and another subscription is using a separate availability zone altogether.\\n\\n![AzureAvailabilityZones_Logical](/uploads/azureavailabilityzones_logical.png \\"AzureAvailabilityZones_Logical\\")\\n\\n**One of the reasons the logical and physical zones are different is due to capacity management**; out of habit, many people select Zone 1 - this would mean that certain zones become overpopulated while others are underutilized. The logical zones allow Microsoft some ability to spread the load.\\n\\nIt\'s worth noting that **mapping the Logical to Physical Zones of the Avalibility Zones within your region is done when the subscription is created**.\\n\\n##### Checking your Zone Peers using PowerShell and the Azure API\\n\\n**During normal business use - you don\'t need to know any of this; select a zone and deploy**; if you have resources across subscriptions and run into additional latency - this may be why, although each availability zone is connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network with a round-trip latency of less than 2ms.\\n\\nBut suppose you are curious or want to delve deeper into your Disaster Recovery and resiliency architecture within a single region. In that case, it can be helpful to know the mapping.\\n\\nThis information isn\'t fed into the Azure Portal. To find the mapping, we need to query the Azure API directly using the [Check Zone Peers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/subscriptions/check-zone-peers?tabs=HTTP&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Subscriptions - Check Zone Peers\\") endpoint.\\n\\nTo do this, I have written a rough PowerShell script that will register the AvailabilityZonePeering Azure feature that you need to enable the lookup and query the API for the mappings.\\n\\n    # Connect to Azure using Get-AzAccount\\n    Connect-AzAccount\\n    \\n    # Set the region to \'Australia East\'\\n    $region = \'Australia East\'\\n    \\n    # Get all subscriptions that the account has access to\\n    $subscriptions = Get-AzSubscription | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SubscriptionId\\n    \\n    # Get the access token for the authenticated user\\n    $token = (Get-AzAccessToken).Token\\n    \\n    # Check if AvailabilityZonePeering feature is enabled and enable it if it\'s not\\n    $azFeature = Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Resources -FeatureName AvailabilityZonePeering\\n    if (!$azFeature.RegistrationState.Equals(\\"Registered\\")) {\\n        do {\\n            Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AvailabilityZonePeering -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Resources\\n            Start-Sleep -Seconds 5\\n            $azFeature = Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Resources -FeatureName AvailabilityZonePeering\\n        } until ($azFeature.RegistrationState.Equals(\\"Registered\\"))\\n        Write-Host \\"The AvailabilityZonePeering feature has been enabled.\\"\\n    } else {\\n        Write-Host \\"The AvailabilityZonePeering feature is already enabled.\\"\\n    }\\n    \\n    # Define the request body for the REST API call\\n    $body = @{\\n        subscriptionIds= $subscriptions | ForEach-Object { \'subscriptions/\' + $_ }\\n        location = $region\\n    } | ConvertTo-Json\\n    \\n    # Define the request parameters for the REST API call\\n    $params = @{\\n        Uri         = \\"https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/\\" + $subscriptions[0] + \\n                      \\"/providers/Microsoft.Resources/checkZonePeers/?api-version=2020-01-01\\"\\n        Headers     = @{ \'Authorization\' = \\"Bearer $token\\" }\\n        Method      = \'POST\'\\n        Body        = $body\\n        ContentType = \'application/json\'\\n    }\\n    \\n    # Invoke the REST API and store the response\\n    $availabilityZonePeers =  Invoke-RestMethod @Params\\n    \\n    # Initialize an empty array for the output\\n    $output = @()\\n    \\n    # Loop through each availability zone and its associated peers and add them to the output array\\n    foreach ($i in $availabilityZonePeers.availabilityZonePeers.availabilityZone) {\\n        foreach ($zone in $availabilityZonePeers.availabilityZonePeers[$i-1].peers ) {\\n            $output += New-Object PSObject -Property @{\\n                Zone = $i\\n                MatchesZone = $zone.availabilityZone\\n                SubscriptionId = $zone.subscriptionId\\n            }\\n        }\\n        $output += \\"\\"\\n    }\\n    \\n    # Output the results\\n    $output |  Format-Table\\n\\nOnce we have connected to Microsoft Azure and run the script, we will get an output like the one below, which I ran across my own three subscriptions:\\n\\n| SubscriptionId | MatchesZone | Zone |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| 3bdfd67e-6280-43af-8121-4f04dc84706c | 2 | 1 |\\n| 8df7caa2-95cb-44d1-9ecb-e5220ec6a825 | 1 | 1 |\\n| 119bbbb7-3ab5-4eb3-ab21-3c65f562fbef | 1 | 1 |\\n| 3bdfd67e-6280-43af-8121-4f04dc84706c | 1 | 2 |\\n| 8df7caa2-95cb-44d1-9ecb-e5220ec6a825 | 2 | 2 |\\n| 119bbbb7-3ab5-4eb3-ab21-3c65f562fbef | 2 | 2 |\\n| 3bdfd67e-6280-43af-8121-4f04dc84706c | 3 | 3 |\\n| 8df7caa2-95cb-44d1-9ecb-e5220ec6a825 | 3 | 3 |\\n| 119bbbb7-3ab5-4eb3-ab21-3c65f562fbef | 3 | 3 |\\n\\nOn the right-hand side, we see the \'Zones\' - these are the Physical Zones, so Zone 1 to 3.\\n\\nFor each subscription, we can see the Logical Zone mapping as well.\\n\\nIn this example, my subscription of \'3bdfd67e-6280-43af-8121-4f04dc84706c\', if I were to deploy to Zone 2 in my Azure Portal, would deploy to the same physical datacenter as Zone 1 of: \'8df7caa2-95cb-44d1-9ecb-e5220ec6a825\'.\\n\\nAs you can also see, my Zone 3 matches the same Zone 3 logically and physically for all my subscriptions, but there are differences between Zone 2 and 1.\\n\\nAgain, during normal business as usual, you don\'t need to know this - but it\'s always good to know how this works.

This means that a single resource group can only contain 800 historical deployments at most.\\n\\n> A deployment in Azure refers to the process of creating or updating resources in a resource group.\\n\\nWhen deploying resources in Azure, it is essential to keep track of the number of [historic deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deployment-history?tabs=azure-portal&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"View deployment history with Azure Resource Manager\\") in a resource group to ensure that the limit is not exceeded. This is because new deployments will fail if the limit is exceeded, and creating or updating resources in that resource group will not be possible.\\n\\nIf you have CI/CD _(Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)_ set up to deploy or change your infrastructure or services with code, it can be easy to reach this limit. [Azure will attempt to do this automatically](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/troubleshooting/deployment-quota-exceeded?tabs=azure-cli&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Resolve error when deployment count exceeds 800\\") when reaching your limit. Still, you may want to pre-empt any problems if you make many deployments and the system hasn\'t had time to prune automatically, or this is [disabed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deployment-history-deletions?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796&tabs=azure-powershell).\\n\\nThis came up in conversations on Microsoft Q&A, so I thought I would dig into it and put together a possible option.\\n\\nTo avoid exceeding the deployment limit, it may be necessary to clean up old deployments.\\n\\nThis can be done by using a script to remove deployments that are no longer needed.\\n\\nSo let\'s build an Azure DevOps pipeline that runs weekly to connect to our Microsoft Azure environment and clean up historical deployments.\\n\\n![Microsoft Azure Deployment History Cleanup with Azure DevOps](/uploads/azdeploycleanupazdevopsheader.png \\"Microsoft Azure Deployment History Cleanup with Azure DevOps\\")\\n\\nFor this article, I will assume you have an Azure DevOps repository setup and the permissions _(Owner)_ to make the necessary privileged actions to the Microsoft Azure environment to do the design.\\n\\n> Note: Scripts and pipeline are \\"[here](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/AzDeploymeantCleanup \\"lukemurraynz / AzDeploymeantCleanup\\")\\".\\n\\n#### Deploy and Configure\\n\\n##### Create Service Prinicipal\\n\\n 1. Navigate to the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure\\")\\n 2. Click on [**Microsoft Entra ID**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/\\\\~/Overview \\"Microsoft Entra ID\\")\\n 3. Click on [**App Registrations**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/\\\\~/RegisteredApps \\"Azure App Registrations\\")\\n 4. Click on: **+ New Registration**\\n 5. Enter the following information:\\n    * **Name** (i.e. SPN.AzDeploymentCleanup)\\n 6. Click **Register**\\n 7.

Click a management group, click on **Access Control (IAM)**\\n 4. Click **+ Add**\\n 5. Click **Add Custom Role**\\n 6. Type in a role name _(an example is: AzDeploymentHistoryCleanup)_\\n 7. Check Start from **Scratch** and next click\\n 8. Click **+ Add permissions** and the permissions above _(you can search for them)_. Feel free to import the role from a JSON file \\"[here](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/AzDeploymeantCleanup \\"AzDeploymeantCleanup\\")\\".\\n 9. Click **Next**\\n10. Add **Assignable Scopes** _(this is the scope you can use to assign a role to - this won\'t give it to the Service Principal; it will only open it up so we can post it)_. Make sure you set it at the management group level you are targetting.\\n11. Click **Review + Create**\\n12. Click **Create**\\n\\n##### Assign Permissions\\n\\nNow that the custom role has been created, it is time to assign it to the service principal we made earlier.\\n\\n 1. Navigate to the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure\\")\\n 2. In the search bar above, type in and navigate to [**Management Groups**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ManagementGroups/ManagementGroupBrowseBlade/\\\\~/MGBrowse_overview \\"Management Groups\\")\\n 3. Click on the management group you want to manage and click on **Access Control (IAM)**\\n 4. Click **Add**\\n 5. Click **Add Role Assignment**\\n 6. Select your custom role _(you can toggle the type column, so CustomRoles are first in the list)_\\n 7. ![Microsoft Azure - add role assignments](/uploads/microsoft-azure-add-roleassignments.png \\"Microsoft Azure - add role assignments\\")\\n 8. Click **Members**\\n 9. Make sure \'_User, group or service principal_\' is selected and click **+ Select Members**\\n10. ![Microsoft Azure - Add Roles](/uploads/azdeploycleanupaddrolemembers.png \\"Microsoft Azure - Add Roles\\").\\n11. Select your Service Principal created earlier _(i.e. SPN.AzDeploymentCleanup)_\\n12. Click **Select**\\n13. Click **Review + assign** to assign the role.\\n\\nNote: Copy the Management Group ID and name, as we will need the information, along with the Service Principal and tenant IDs from earlier, in the next step of setting up Azure DevOps.\\n\\n##### Configure Azure DevOps Service Endpoint\\n\\nNow that the Service Principal and permissions have been assigned in Azure, it\'s time to create the service connection endpoint that will allow Azure DevOps to connect to Azure.\\n\\n 1. Navigate to your [**Azure DevOps**](http://dev.azure.com/ \\"Azure DevOps\\") organisation.\\n 2. Create a **Project**, if you haven\'t already\\n 3. Click on **Project Settings**\\n 4. Navigate to **Service Connection**\\n 5. Click on **New service connection**\\n 6. Select **Azure Resource Manager**\\n 7. Click **Next**\\n 8. Select **Service principal (manual)**\\n 9. Click **Next**\\n10. For the scope, choose Group Management\\n11. Enter the **Management Group ID**, the **Management Group Name**\\n12. Time to enter in the Service Principal details copied earlier, for the Service Principal Id paste in the Application ID.\\n13. The Service Principal key, enter the secret client value and select the Tenant ID\\n14. Click **Verify** - to verify the connectivity to the azure platform from Azure DevOps\\n15. Select **Grant access permission to all pipelines** and click **Verify and save**\\n\\n##### Configure script and pipeline\\n\\nNow that we have our:\\n\\n* Azure Service Principal\\n* Custom role and assignment\\n* Service connection\\n\\nWe now need to import the script and pipeline.\\n\\nIf you haven\'t already done - [create a Repo](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/repos/git/create-new-repo?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Create a new Git repo in your project\\") for the AzHistoryCleanup writing.\\n\\nYou can clone _(or copy)_ the files in the [**AzDeploymentCleanup**](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/AzDeploymeantCleanup \\"AzDeploymeantCleanup\\") Repo to your own.\\n\\nFirst, we need to copy the name of the Service Principal.\\n\\n1. Click **Project settings**\\n2. Click **Service Connections**\\n3. Click on your **Service Connection** and copy the **name** _(i.e. SC.AzDeploymentCleanup)_\\n4. ![Azure DevOps Service Principal](/uploads/azuredevops_spn.png \\"Azure DevOps Service Principal\\")\\n5. Navigate back to your Repo, and click on **AzDeploymentCleanup.yml** (this will become your pipeline)\\n6. Click **Edit**\\n7. ![Edit AzDeploymentCleanup YML](/uploads/select-azure-devops-edityaml.png \\"Edit AzDeploymentCleanup YML\\")\\n8. Update the variable for **ConnectedServiceNameARM** to the name of your service connection\\n9. Here you can also edit the **Script Arguments** - for example, in my demo, I am targeting the **ManagementGroup** named: mg-landing zones and keeping the latest five **deployments**.\\n10. By default, I also have a [cron job](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/scheduled-triggers?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Configure schedules for pipelines\\") to schedule this pipeline at 6 AM UTC every Sunday, and you can remove or edit this.\\n11. Once your changes are made, click **Commit.**\\n12. Now that your pipeline has been updated, its time to create it - click on **Pipelines.**\\n13. Click **New Pipeline**\\n14.

Azure Backup does this by preventing any operations which could lead to the loss of backup data.\\n\\nHence, this helps you protect your backups against ransomware attacks and malicious actors by disallowing operations such as deleting backups or reducing retention in backup policies.\\n\\n> [Immutable vaults is now Generally available](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-backup-immutable-vaults-ga?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Generally available: Immutable vaults for Azure Backup\\") in all regions (March 13th 2023).\\n\\nAn immutable vault can assist in safeguarding your backup data by prohibiting any actions that might result in the loss of recovery points.\\n\\n![Can\'t touch this](/uploads/can-ttouchthis_immutability.png)\\n\\nBy securing the immutable vault setting, it can be made irreversible, which can prevent any unauthorized individuals from disabling the immutability feature and erasing the backups.\\n\\nThe Immutable vault configuration supports both Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults.\\n\\n> While Azure Backup stores data in isolation from production workloads, it allows performing management operations to help you manage your backups, including those operations that allow you to delete recovery points. However, in certain scenarios, you may want to make the backup data immutable by preventing any such operations that, if used by malicious actors, could lead to the loss of backups. The Immutable vault setting on your vault enables you to block such operations to ensure that your backup data is protected, even if any malicious actors try to delete them to affect the recoverability of data.\\n\\nEnabling immutability for the vault is a reversible operation. However, you can make it irreversible to prevent any malicious actors from disabling it _(after disabling it, they can perform destructive functions)_.\\n\\nThe type of operations enabling immutability on the Azure Backup vault can prevent and safeguard from is.\\n\\n| System | Operation type | Description |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Recovery Services Vault & Backup Vault | Stop protection with delete data | A protected item can\'t have its recovery points deleted before their respective expiry date. However, you can still stop protection of the instances while retaining data forever or until their expiry. |\\n| Recovery Services Vault | Modify backup policy to reduce retention | Any actions that reduce the retention period in a backup policy are disallowed on Immutable vault. However, you can make policy changes that result in the increase of retention. You can also make changes to the schedule of a backup policy. |\\n| Recovery Services Vault | Change backup policy to reduce retention | Any attempt to replace a backup policy associated with a backup item with another policy with retention lower than the existing one is blocked. However, you can replace a policy with the one that has higher retention. |\\n\\nThere are three current states for the immutability of the Backup and Recovery Services Vault:\\n\\n* Disabled\\n* Enabled _(soft immutability)_\\n* Enabled and locked _(hard immutability)_\\n\\n| State of Immutable vault setting | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Disabled | The vault doesn\'t have immutability enabled and no operations are blocked. |\\n| Enabled | The vault has immutability enabled and doesn\'t allow operations that could result in loss of backups. However, the setting can be disabled. |\\n| Enabled and locked | The vault has immutability enabled and doesn\'t allow operations that could result in loss of backups. As the Immutable vault setting is now locked, it can\'t be disabled. Note that immutability locking is irreversible, so ensure that you take a well-informed decision when opting to lock. |\\n\\nImmutable vaults and [multi-user authorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/multi-user-authorization-concept?tabs=recovery-services-vault&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Multi-user authorization using Resource Guard\\") can safeguard your backups from various human and technological accidents or disruptions.\\n\\nImmutable vaults will not affect live or hot backups, such as snapshots.\\n\\nUsing the Azure Portal, let us configure immutability on your Azure Backup Vault.\\n\\n 1.

there is no built-in geo-filtering with Azure Firewall, as you can use other services, such as the Web Application Gateway and with the [Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"What is Azure Application Gateway?\\") and [Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/waf-front-door-geo-filtering?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"What is geo-filtering on a domain for Azure Front Door Service?\\") to block and allow access, and other third party services such as Cloudflare. This script can be adapted for any list of IP ranges; it doesn\'t need to be country IP addresses.\\n\\nHowever, you may want to control access to and from specific countries _(or other services)_ with Azure Firewall - this is where the IP Groups can be effective, and because we won\'t be editing the Firewall directly - we won\'t run into issues with delays without having to wait for the Azure Firewall policies to be updated.\\n\\nTo solve the issue of creating the IP groups and finding and keeping the IP groups up-to-date with various countries\' IP ranges - I have created a PowerShell function to retrieve supported [countries](https://www.ipdeny.com/ipblocks/data/aggregated/ \\"IP Deny aggregated list\\")\' IP CIDR ranges and create the relevant IP groups.\\n\\n![Azure IP Group - Country IP ranges](/uploads/azureipgroupscript.png \\"Azure IP Group - Country IP ranges\\")\\n\\nWith IP Groups, there are a few things to keep in mind:\\n\\n* You can have 200 IP Groups per firewall with a maximum of **5000 individual IP addresses or prefixes per each IP Group**.\\n\\nFor a country like New Zealand, the 5000 limit for the address ranges is acceptable - but for other countries, like the United States or United Kingdom, this can be an issue, where the total IP ranges can grow to over 20k - to deal with this, the script will create multiple IP Groups, and append a number to the end.\\n\\nSuppose IPs are manually added to the groups. In that case, they won\'t be added - the script will add in any different or new IP ranges, ignoring any current IP ranges (_this means it won\'t delete any IP ranges that are removed from the source IP list from IPDeny)_; however, I recommend that anything added outside of this script is kept in a separate IP group.\\n\\n_As with any script, I recommend this is tested in a test environment first._\\n\\nBefore we run it, we need a few prerequisites.\\n\\n* At least [PowerShell 3.0+](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.3&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Install PowerShell on Windows, Linux, and macOS\\")\\n* Azure [Az PowerShell Modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az?view=azps-9.2.0&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Introducing the Azure Az PowerShell module\\")_(specifically Az.Network, Az.Resources)_\\n\\nThe function assumes you have [connected to Microsoft Azure and your relevant subscription](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/powershell/Using-PowerShell-to-connect-to-Azure/ \\"Using PowerShell to connect to Microsoft Azure\\").\\n\\nBefore we import the function, I am going to check if any IP groups already exist quickly _(this isn\'t required) -_ but it\'s a good opportunity to check that you are connected to your Azure subscription and that the AzIPGroup cmdlets exist -  and whether you have any IP groups already existing.\\n\\n    Get-AzIpGroup\\n\\n![Get-AzIpGroup](/uploads/checkexistingipgroups_empty.gif \\"Get-AzIpGroup\\")\\n\\nI have received no errors or existing IP groups in my subscription, so I will continue importing my function.\\n\\nThe function can be found here:\\n\\n```powershell title=\\"New-AzCountryIPGroup.p1\\"\\nfunction New-AzCountryIPGroup {\\n    <#\\n.SYNOPSIS\\nCreates an Azure IP group, with the IP address ranges for various countrues.\\nThe code does the following:\\n1. It downloads the IP address ranges for the country specified.\\n2. It checks if the IP Group already exists, if it does, it adds the IP addresses to the existing IP Group.\\n3. If the total number of IP addresses is less than 5000, it will add the IP addresses to the existing IP Group.\\n4. If the total number of IP addresses is over 5000, it will create a new IP Group, with the same name as the existing IP Group, and it will add the IP addresses to the new IP Group.\\n5. If the new IP Group is over 5000, it will create a new IP Group, with the same name as the existing IP Group, and it will add the IP addresses to the new IP Group.\\n6. It will continue to create new IP Groups until all of the IP addresses are added.\\n\\nThe code can be used to create IP Groups for multiple countries, and if the number of IP addresses is over 5000, it will create multiple IP Groups, with the same name, but with a counter after the name, so that it will be unique.\\n.EXAMPLE\\nNew-AzCountryIPGroup\\nNew-AzCountryIPGroup -CountryCode NZ -IPGroupName IP -IPGroupRGName NetworkRG -IPGroupLocation AustraliaEast\\n.AUTHOR\\nLuke Murray - https://luke.geek.nz/\\n\\n    #>\\n    [CmdletBinding()]\\n    param\\n    (\\n        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true, Position = 0)]\\n        [System.String]\\n        $CountryCode,\\n        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true, Position = 1)]\\n        [Object]\\n        $IPGroupName,\\n        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true, Position = 2)]\\n        [System.String]\\n        $IPGroupRGName,\\n        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true, Position = 3)]\\n        [System.String]\\n        $IPGroupLocation\\n    )\\n    \\n    \\n    $IPBlocks = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri (\'https://www.ipdeny.com/ipblocks/data/aggregated/{0}-aggregated.zone\' -f $CountryCode.ToLower()) \\n    #Exports the IPBlock content from the HTML request, into a String\\n    $IPBlock = $IPBlocks.Content \\n    #Spilts each IP block, into a seperate object\\n    $ipaddressranges = $IPBlock -split \'\\\\s+\' -replace \'\\\\r?\\\\n\\\\r?\', \'\'  | Where-Object { $_ -ne \'\' }\\n\\n    $Group = Get-AzIpGroup -Name $IPGroupName -ResourceGroupName $IPGroupRGName \\n\\n    if ($ipaddressranges.Length -lt 5000) {\\n\\n        If ($null -eq $Group) {\\n            Write-Host  \\"Group doesn\'t exist, creating a new IP Group called $IPGroupName in the following Azure Resource Group $IPGroupRGName and location $IPGroupLocation\\"\\n            $Group = New-AzIpGroup -Name $IPGroupName -ResourceGroupName $IPGroupRGName -Location $IPGroupLocation -Tag @{Country = $CountryCode } -Verbose\\n        \\n            If ($null -eq $Group) {\\n                New-AzResourceGroup -Name $IPGroupRGName -Location $IPGroupLocation -Tag @{Country = $CountryCode } \\n                $Group = New-AzIpGroup -Name $IPGroupName -ResourceGroupName $IPGroupRGName -Location $IPGroupLocation -Tag @{Country = $CountryCode } -Verbose\\n\\n            }\\n        \\n            ForEach ($ip in $ipaddressranges) {\\n                $Group.IpAddresses.Add($ip) \\n                Write-Host  \\"Adding $ip to $IPGroupName.\\"\\n            }\\n        \\n            $Group | Set-AzIPGroup -Verbose\\n        \\n        }\\n\\n        else {\\n            Write-Host \\"Group already exists called:$IPGroupName in the following Azure Resource Group $IPGroupRGName and location $IPGroupLocation.

These licenses are included in M365 F3, E3, E5, A3, A5, Microsoft Business Premium and Microsoft 365 Education benefit plans.\\n\\n![Microsoft Dev Box](/uploads/microsoft_devbox_selfservicedevelopment.png \\"Microsoft Dev Box\\")\\n\\n> _Disclaimer: At the time of writing, this service is still in Public Preview, some services and license requirements may change by the time this becomes generally avaliable._\\n\\nSo, where does Microsoft Dev Box fit in?\\n\\nMicrosoft offers a plethora of services, from [Azure Virtual Desktop](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/virtual-desktop/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure Virtual Desktop\\"), [Windows 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-365?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Windows 365 Cloud PC\\"), and now [Microsoft Dev Box](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/dev-box/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#overview \\"Microsoft Dev Box\\") - where would you use Microsoft Dev Box over another service, such as Windows 365?\\n\\nGeneral scenarios at a high level are:\\n\\n| Scenario | Product |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Production multi-session, supporting Windows Server and Client OS, Published Aps | Azure Virtual Desktop |\\n| Production dedicated personal PCs, for shift/party time users - or small environments | Windows 365 |\\n| Dev/Test Ondemand Windows machines for Testing and development with custom image support | Azure Dev Box |\\n\\n![Microsot Windows Experiances Strategy](/uploads/ms_microsoftwindowsexperiances_strategy.png \\"Microsoft Windows Experiances Strategy\\")\\n\\nMicrosoft Dev box can help project and development teams get up and running quickly, independent of what hardware a developer or contractor has, whether they prefer Mac, Windows, or Linux - the Microsoft Dev box can be used to get developers and contractors up and running in a secure environment that supports Intune!\\n\\n##### Concepts & Roles\\n\\n| Concepts | Notes |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Dev center | A dev center is a collection of projects that require similar settings. Dev centers enable dev infrastructure managers to manage the images and SKUs available to the projects using dev box definitions and configure the networks the development teams consume using network connections. |\\n| Projects | A project is the point of access for the development team members. When you associate a project with a dev center, all the settings at the dev center level will be applied to the project automatically. Each project can be associated with only one dev center. |\\n| Dev box definition | A dev box definition specifies a source image and size, including compute size and storage size. You can use a source image from the marketplace, or a custom image. |\\n| Network connection | Network connections store configuration information like Active Directory join type and virtual network that dev boxes use to connect to network resources. |\\n| Dev box pool | A dev box pool is a collection of dev boxes that you manage together and to which you apply similar settings. |\\n| Dev box | A dev box is a preconfigured ready-to-code workstation that you create through the self-service developer portal. The new dev box has all the tools, binaries, and configuration required for a dev box user to be productive immediately |\\n\\n![DevBoxHierarchy](/uploads/festivetechcalendar2022_devboxhierarchy.png \\"DevBoxHierarchy\\")\\n\\nThe following are typical Azure Dev Box roles.\\n\\n| Role | Responsibilities | Permissions |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Dev Infra Admins | Providing developer infrastructure and tools to the development teas | Can create and manage dev centers, can create projects and define images that are used to create the dev boxes |\\n| Project Admins | Does administrative tasks for the Dev Box solution and assist with day to day tasks. | Can create and manage dev box pools across different regions |\\n| Dev Box Users | Members of your development teams | Can self-service and create one or more dev boxes, depending on the projects assigned. |\\n\\n#### Deployment\\n\\n##### Create Dev Center\\n\\nFirst, we need to create our [Dev Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/dev-box/concept-dev-box-concepts?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#dev-center \\"Microsoft Dev Box Preview key concepts\\"). A Dev Center allows us to centrally manage our developer environments and enable development teams with self-service capability. Dev Center is used by more than just Microsoft DevBox - an example is [Azure Deployment Environments](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/deployment-environments/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#overview \\"Azure Deployment Environments\\") - which allows devs to spin up templated _(ARM)_ application infrastructure quickly - but we will focus on components of Dev Center - used by Microsoft Dev Box.\\n\\n> Please confirm what [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/dev-box/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#faq \\"Frequently asked questions about Microsoft Dev Box\\") you can deploy Dev Box. As this is in Public Preview at the time of writing - only certain regions are supported.\\n\\nLet\'s create a standard Dev Box environment in your favourite browser, starting with the Dev Center...\\n\\n1. Log in to the Microsoft [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n2. Click **+ Create a resource**\\n3. Search for: Dev center, select your Dev center and click **Create**\\n4. ![Microsoft Azure Portal - Dev center](/uploads/azuredevbox-createdevcentermarketplace.png \\"Microsoft Azure Portal - Dev center\\")\\n5. Select the **Subscription** and **ResourceGroup** you want to deploy your Dev Center; you can use this opportunity to create a new Resource Group.\\n6. Type in the **name__ of your** DevCenter **_(in my example, it is named DevCenter-Devs)_\\n7. Then select the **location** _(region)_ in which you want to deploy your DevCenter.\\n8. ![Azure Portal - Create a dev center](/uploads/azuredevbox-createdevcenterbasicspage.png \\"Azure Portal - Create a dev center\\")\\n9. Click **Review + Create,** then **Create**\\n\\n_Deployment of the Microsoft Dev Center will take a few minutes._\\n\\n##### Create Virtual Network\\n\\nTo use Microsoft Dev Boxes - like any Virtual Machine in Azure, you need a Virtual Network! The Dev Boxes can connect to existing Virtual Networks, which could be peered with other VNETs, have connectivity to on-premises - or have standalone secure connectivity through network links! In my demo, I don\'t currently have a Virtual Network - so I will create a Virtual Network from scratch.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the Microsoft [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Click **+ Create a resource**\\n 3. Search for: **Virtual Network**\\n 4. **Create** a **Virtual Network**\\n 5. **Select** your Virtual Network **name** and **region** _(make sure the region aligns with your workloads and Azure DevCenter location)_\\n 6. ![Azure Portal - Create VNET](/uploads/azuredevbox-createvnetbasicspage.png \\"Azure Portal - Create VNET\\")\\n 7. Click **Next: IP Addresses**\\n 8. I will leave the IP address space the default of 10.1.0.0/16 - but change the default subnet name to devbox-subnet.\\n 9. ![Azure Portal - Create VNET](/uploads/azuredevbox-createvnetipaddressespage.png \\"Azure Portal - Create VNET\\")\\n10. Click **Review + create**\\n11. Click **Create**\\n\\n##### Create a Virtual Network Connection and link to Dev Center\\n\\nNow that we have our Dev Center and our Virtual Network - it\'s time to make a Network connection - this connection will be used by Dev Center - to allow our Dev Boxes to connect to the Virtual Network - and to select your Virtual Machine identification _(i.e. Microsoft Entra ID, or Hybrid Microsoft Entra ID)_.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the Microsoft [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Click **+ Create a resource.**\\n 3. Type in: **Network Connection,** find and click **Create**\\n 4. ![Create Network Connection ](/uploads/azuredevbox-createnetworkconnectionmarketplace.png \\"Create Network Connection \\")\\n 5. As I will be using Microsoft Entra ID joined Virtual Machines, I will ensure that the Domain join type is: **Microsoft Entra ID join**.\\n 6. For the **Network connection name**, I will select: ProductionVNETAADJConnection\\n 7. I will select my Virtual Network and subnet, which the Dev Box will be placed into.\\n 8. ![Create Azure Network Connection ](/uploads/azuredevbox-createnetworkconnectionbasicspage.png \\"Create Azure Network Connection \\")\\n 9. Click **Review + Create,** and click **Create**\\n10. Now that we have created the Network connection - it is time to link it to our Dev Center - so it can be used.\\n11. **Navigate** to your **Dev Center**\\n12. Under Dev Box configuration, select **Networking**\\n13. Click **+ Add**\\n14. **Select** your Network **connection** that has just been created\\n15. ![Azure Dev Center - Link Network Connection](/uploads/azuredevbox-createnetworkconnectionlinkdevcenter.png \\"Azure Dev Center - Link Network Connection\\")\\n16. Click **Add**\\n17. The Network Connection will check all the network requirements for the Dev Box service, such as the Azure tenant and Intune configuration _(i.e. is there a restriction in Endpoint Management for Windows)._\\n\\n##### Create Dev box definitions\\n\\nIt\'s time to create our Dev box definition. The Dev box definition is the type of Virtual Machines -or Dev Boxes that are standard for your environment. A dev box definition will be used to define the image _(whether a_ [_custom_](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/capturing-virtual-machine-images-and-snapshots-in-azure-using-wvdadmin/ \\"Capturing Virtual Machine images and Snapshots in Azure using WVDAdmin\\") _or marketplace image),_ SKU of virtual machines _(Compute + Memory)_, and available storage. Note that if you want to use a Custom Image - you will need an [Azure Compute gallery](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/azure-compute-gallery?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Store and share resources in an Azure Compute Gallery\\"), and if you decide to go down this route, make sure you check out [Azure VM Image Builder](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/image-builder-overview?tabs=azure-powershell&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure VM Image Builder overview\\") to help automate and build your images. You can have multiple definitions per project.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the Microsoft [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Navigate to your **Dev center**\\n 3. Navigate to **Dev box definitions**\\n 4. Click **+ Create**\\n 5. For our **Image definition name**, I will go with Win11-VS\\n 6. For Images, there are a plethora of images available! For this guide, I will use Visual Studio 2019 Enterprise on Windows 11 Enterprise + Microsoft 365 Apps 22H2 image.\\n 7. ![Azure Dev Box definitions](/uploads/azuredevbox-createpdevboxdefinitionsimages.png \\"Azure Dev Box definitions\\")\\n 8. I will select the Latest image version and specify **4vCPU, 16GB of RAM**, and a **256 GB** SSD drive.\\n 9. ![Azure Dev Box definitions](/uploads/azuredevbox-createpdevboxdefinitions.png \\"Azure Dev Box definitions\\")\\n10. Click **Create**\\n\\nYou can edit a Dev box definition, change the image, Compute, and storage after it has been created; this could be useful if there are issues with the latest version of the image, you can roll back the version - so people can make their Dev Boxes while the image is worked on.\\n\\n##### Create and assign Project\\n\\nNow that we have our Dev Center and Virtual Network connection - it is time to create a Project. A Project is intended to be task specific - an example being the following user story _\\"As a developer working on a mobile game, I need access to a Windows 11 Development workstation with Visual Studio installed\\"_ - so all users working on that mobile game - will get an identical virtual machine setup with all the pre-requisites that the need to start development, a project team working on another mobile game, may need different software or dependencies - so will be part of another project.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the Microsoft [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Navigate to your **Dev center**\\n 3. Navigate to **Projects**\\n 4. Select **+ Create**\\n 5. Select your **Resource Group**\\n 6. Select your **Dev center**\\n 7. Please type in the name of our **Project** and enter a **description.**\\n 8. ![Azure DevBox - Create Project](/uploads/azuredevbox-createprojectbasics.png)\\n 9. You can use Tags to add additional information on billing for the project or the project administrator\'s contact details - but we will select **Review + create** and **Create**\\n10. Once the Project has been created, we need to assign assignees to use the project. I will give a DevBox User role to the project so I can make a Dev Box.\\n11. Within the Project, click on the **Access Control (IAM)**\\n12. Click **+ Add**\\n13. Select **Add Role assignment**\\n14. Select **DevCenter Dev Box User**\\n15. Click **Next**\\n16. Make sure User, Group, or Service principal is selected and click **+ Select Members.**\\n17. Ideally, you would assign the Dev Box User role to an Azure AD group - but in my demo, I will select an individual user.\\n18. Click **Next**\\n19. ![Azure Dev Box - Assign Project Members](/uploads/azuredevbox-assignprojectmembers.png \\"Azure Dev Box - Assign Project Members\\")\\n20. Once you have confirmed your users have been assigned, click on **Review + assign** to give your users or groups to the project, allowing them to create Dev Boxes.\\n\\n_Note: I have found it can take 5-10 minutes for access to be granted to the users before they can create Dev Boxes._\\n\\n##### Create Dev Box Pool\\n\\nNow that we have our project and dev box definitions - it\'s time to create our Dev Box Pool - which is what the Dev Boxes will be made from.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the Microsoft [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Navigate to your **Dev center**\\n 3. Navigate to **Projects**\\n 4. **Navigate** to **the project** you created earlier _(i.e. for me, its MobileGameDevelopment)_\\n 5. Click on the **Dev box pools**\\n 6. Click on **+ Create**\\n 7. ![Azure Dev Box - Create Dev Box Pools](/uploads/azuredevbox-createdevboxpools.png \\"Azure Dev Box - Create Dev Box Pools\\")\\n 8. Type in a **name** - _i.e. MobleDevelopmentWin11_\\n 9. **Select** your **Network connection**\\n10. Select your **definition**\\n11. Select your Creator **privileges** _(i.e. select whether your user will be a standard user or have Local administrator rights on their devbox)_\\n12. Configure Auto-stop or skip and confirm [licensing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/windows-desktop-multitenant-hosting-deployment?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"How to deploy Windows 11 on Azure\\").\\n13. Click **Create**\\n\\nAfter 1-2 minutes, your Dev Box pool has been created.\\n\\n#### Create & Connect\\n\\nNow that your Dev Center, Network, and Dev Box project has been stood up - it\'s time to Create and connect to your new Dev box! Microsoft Dev Box - offers a few ways to connect to the DevBox; we will go through a few options now.\\n\\n##### Create Dev Box\\n\\nNow it\'s time to create our Dev Box! To do this, we need to go to the Dev box Developer portal _(as a Dev Center Devbox, User)_\\n\\n1. Navigate to the [**Microsoft Dev Box portal**](https://devbox.microsoft.com/ \\"Microsoft Dev Box\\")\\n2. Click on **+ New Dev Box**\\n3. Enter your **name** of the DevBox _(i.e. what you will name the Virtual Machine and see in the portal - make sure this is meaningful - as you may have more than one Dev Box)_\\n4. **Select** your assigned **Dev Box Pool,** and select your **Dev Box definition**\\n5. ![Microsoft Dev Box - Create Virtual Machine](/uploads/azuredevbox-createdevbox.png \\"Microsoft Dev Box - Create Virtual Machine\\")\\n6. Click **Create**\\n7. ![DevBox - Creating ](/uploads/devboxcreating.gif \\"DevBox - Creating \\")\\n\\n_Note: Dev box creation can take 30-90 minutes. **Dev boxes will automatically start upon creation.**_\\n\\n##### Connect Dev Box using Microsoft Dev Box Portal\\n\\n1. Navigate to the [**Microsoft Dev Box portal**](https://devbox.microsoft.com/ \\"Microsoft Dev Box\\")\\n2. **Click** on the Dev **Box** you want to connect to.\\n3. Select **Open in the browser**\\n4. ![Azure DevBox - HTML Client](/uploads/azuredevbox-desktophtml.png \\"Azure DevBox - HTML Client\\")\\n5. ![Azure Dev Box /Windows 365 Connection](/uploads/azuredevbox-desktophtmlconnecting.png \\"Azure Dev Box/Windows 365 Connection\\")\\n6. If prompted, then log in with your credentials.\\n7. ![Azure Dev Box - Sign In](/uploads/azuredevbox-desktophtml_login.png \\"Azure Dev Box - Sign In\\")\\n8. You will now be connected to your new Azure Dev Box!\\n9. ![Azure Dev Box](/uploads/azuredevbox-desktophtmldevbox.jpg \\"Azure Dev Box\\")\\n\\n##### Connect Dev Box using Remote Desktop Application\\n\\nLike Azure Virtual Desktop, you can connect to your Dev Box using the Remote Desktop client.\\n\\n1. Download and install the [**Remote Desktop Client**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/users/connect-windows?tabs=subscribe&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Remote Desktop Client\\")\\n2. [**Subscribe**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/users/connect-windows?tabs=subscribe-with-url&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#subscribe-to-a-workspace \\"Subscribe to a workspace\\") to the Azure workspace\\n3. As long as the Dev Box has been created, you can see your Dev Box and connect to it directly.\\n4. ![Remote Desktop Client - Microsoft Dev Box](/uploads/azuredevbox-remotedesktopapplication.png \\"Remote Desktop Client - Microsoft Dev Box\\")\\n\\n#### Configuration\\n\\nWe can configure a few extra things for the Azure DevBox environment.\\n\\n##### Auto-Stop\\n\\nAs the Dev Box is Pay As You Go, you can ensure that a Dev Box is shut down after hours.\\n\\n1. Log in to the Microsoft [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n2. Navigate to your **Dev center**\\n3. Navigate to **Projects**\\n4. **Navigate** to **the project** you created earlier _(i.e. for me, its MobileGameDevelopment)_\\n5. Click on the **Dev box pools**\\n6. Click on **Edit** on your pools\\n7. Click **Enable Auto-stop**\\n8. Select **Yes**\\n9. Configure your **Stop Time** and **time zone**\\n\\nYou may also have multiple pools - selected with the exact Dev box image definition - if your project runs across various timezones, so you can schedule a 7 PM Shutdown in New Zealand and a 7 PM shutdown for those developers in the United States.\\n\\n##### Delete or Stop\\n\\nNot as much as a Configuration item, but more of a quick - howto! As a Dev Box user, you can shut down your Dev Box or delete it from the [**Microsoft Dev Box portal**](https://devbox.microsoft.com/ \\"Microsoft Dev Box\\")**.**\\n\\n![Azure Dev Box - Stop or Delete](/uploads/azuredevbox-closedelete.png \\"Azure Dev Box - Stop or Delete\\")\\n\\n#### Additional Resources\\n\\nAs Microsoft Dev Box is still in Public Preview - at the time of writing - the experience may change before its GA (Generally available). \\n\\n##### Documentation\\n\\nAdditional reading on Microsoft Dev Box can be found below:\\n\\n* [Microsoft Dev Box](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/dev-box/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Microsoft Dev Box\\")\\n* [Microsoft Dev Box pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/dev-box/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Microsoft Dev Box PREVIEW pricing\\")\\n* [Build developer environments fast with Microsoft Dev Box - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyeuSpR74W4)\\n\\n##### Azure Bicep\\n\\nBelow are some Azure Bicep samples for Azure Dev Box.\\n\\n###### Dev Center\\n\\n    param name string\\n    param location string\\n    param tags object\\n    \\n    resource name_resource \'Microsoft.DevCenter/devcenters@2022-08-01-preview\' = {\\n      name: name\\n      location: location\\n      tags: tags\\n      identity: {\\n        type: \'none\'\\n      }\\n    }\\n\\n###### DevBox Host Pool\\n\\n    param projects_MobileGameDevelopment_name string = \'MobileGameDevelopment\'\\n    \\n    resource projects_MobileGameDevelopment_name_MobleDevelopmentWin10Secure \'Microsoft.DevCenter/projects/pools@2022-09-01-preview\' = {\\n      name: \'${projects_MobileGameDevelopment_name}/MobleDevelopmentWin10Secure\'\\n      location: \'australiaeast\'\\n      properties: {\\n        devBoxDefinitionName: \'Win10-VS\'\\n        networkConnectionName: \'ProductionVNETAADJConnection\'\\n        licenseType: \'Windows_Client\'\\n        localAdministrator: \'Disabled\'\\n      }\\n    }\\n    \\n    resource projects_MobileGameDevelopment_name_MobleDevelopmentWin10Secure_default \'Microsoft.DevCenter/projects/pools/schedules@2022-09-01-preview\' = {\\n      parent: projects_MobileGameDevelopment_name_MobleDevelopmentWin10Secure\\n      name: \'default\'\\n      properties: {\\n        type: \'StopDevBox\'\\n        frequency: \'Daily\'\\n        time: \'11:15\'\\n        timeZone: \'Pacific/Auckland\'\\n        state: \'Enabled\'\\n      }\\n    }"},{"id":"azure/hosting-your-workloads-in-azure-vs-on-premises","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/hosting-your-workloads-in-azure-vs-on-premises","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-05-hosting-your-workloads-in-azure-vs-on-premises.md","title":"Hosting your workloads in Azure vs On-premises","description":"Azure is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services and capabilities for building and deploying applications and workloads in the cloud.

In contrast, hosting your own datacenter involves setting up and managing a physical infrastructure, including servers, storage, networking, and other components, in a location controlled by the organization.\\n\\nAzure and hosting your own datacenter are two different approaches for deploying and managing applications and workloads.\\n\\nThere are several key differences between Azure and hosting your own datacenter, including the following:\\n\\n* Capital expenditure and operational costs: Azure is a pay-as-you-go service, with no upfront costs or long-term commitments, while hosting your own datacenter involves a significant capital expenditure, and ongoing costs for maintenance, support, and infrastructure upgrades.\\n* Scalability and elasticity: Azure provides automatic scalability and elasticity, with the ability to scale up and down on demand, and pay only for the resources that are used, while hosting your own datacenter requires manual scaling and capacity planning, and may result in underutilized or overutilized resources.\\n* Security and compliance: Azure provides built-in security and compliance features, with the ability to deploy and manage applications and workloads in a secure and compliant manner, while hosting your own datacenter requires the implementation and maintenance of security and compliance controls, and may expose the organization to security and compliance risks.\\n* Integration and interoperability: Azure integrates well with other Azure services and technologies, as well as with on-premises environments, while hosting your own datacenter may require the use of complex integration and interoperability solutions, and may result in vendor lock-in and interoperability challenges.\\n\\nOverall, Azure and hosting your own datacenter are two different approaches, with different advantages and disadvantages. Azure can provide a more cost-effective, scalable, and secure solution, but may require the adoption of a different operating model and a learning curve, while hosting your own datacenter can provide more control and flexibility, but may require a larger investment and ongoing operational costs.\\n\\nThe [total cost of ownership (TCO) of Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/tco/calculator/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator\\") and on-premises can vary depending on several factors, including the specific services and resources that are used, the usage patterns and workloads, the pricing options and discounts, and the cost optimization strategies and techniques that are implemented.\\n\\nIn general, the TCO of Azure can be lower than the TCO of on-premises, for the following reasons:\\n\\n* Azure provides a pay-as-you-go pricing model, with no upfront costs or long-term commitments, and the ability to scale up and down on demand, and pay only for the resources that are used. This can help to reduce the overall TCO, compared to the upfront capital expenditure and ongoing operational costs of on-premises infrastructure.\\n* Azure provides built-in support and maintenance services, as part of the subscription fees, and the ability to choose from different support and maintenance plans, depending on the specific needs and requirements of the organization. This can help to reduce the TCO, compared to the costs of hiring and maintaining a dedicated IT staff for on-premises infrastructure.\\n* Azure provides built-in security and compliance features, and the ability to deploy and manage applications and workloads in a secure and compliant manner. This can help to reduce the TCO, compared to the costs of implementing and maintaining security and compliance controls for on-premises infrastructure.\\n\\nOverall, the TCO of Azure can be lower than the TCO of on-premises, due to the pay-as-you-go pricing model, the built-in support and maintenance services, and the built-in security and compliance features.

This is where the following Azure Automation runbook can help.\\n\\n_Feel free to check out a_ [_previous article_](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/sftp-in-microsoft-azure-using-azure-blob-storage/ \\"SFTP in Microsoft Azure using Azure Blob Storage \\") _on setting up SFTP support for an Azure storage account._\\n\\n#### Overview\\n\\nUsing an [Azure Automation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"What is Azure Automation?\\") PowerShell runbook and Schedules _(as part of the Azure Automation account)_  - we can turn on the SFTP endpoint - when we need it and disable it - the rest of the time - which is excellent from a security and cost perspective.\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\nTo do this, we will need an:\\n\\n* Azure Automation Account\\n* System Managed Identity set with Storage Account Contributor rights\\n* PowerShell runbook _(supplied below)_\\n\\nFor this article, I will assume you already have an Azure Automation account - if you do not - then follow the Microsoft documentation: [Create a standalone Azure Automation account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-create-standalone-account?tabs=azureportal&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Create a standalone Azure Automation account\\").\\n\\n#### Deploy & Configure\\n\\nNow that the Azure Automation account has been configured and set up - we need to add the Runbook, but before we can do that - there are some dependencies. For example, SFTP is a new service that the currently installed Az Modules in the Azure Automation don\'t have visibility on - so to configure the SFTP service - we need to update 2 Modules to the most recent version.\\n\\nThese modules are:\\n\\n* Az.Accounts _(\u2265 2.10.3)_\\n* Az.Storage\\n\\nAz.Accounts are a dependent service of the latest Az.Storage account, so let us import that first.\\n\\n##### Update Az.Accounts module\\n\\n1. In the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\"), navigate to [**Azure Automation accounts**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Automation%2FAutomationAccounts \\"Azure Automation Accounts\\").\\n2. Find your Azure Automation account and, click on it, navigate to **Modules** _(under Shared resources)_.\\n3. Select **Browse Gallery**\\n4. Search for: **Az.Accounts**\\n5. ![Import Az.Accounts](/uploads/azautomation_gallery_azaccounts.png \\"Az.Accounts\\")\\n6. Click \'**Az.Accounts**\' and select **Select.**\\n7. Set the **runtime** version to: **5.1** & select impor**t**\\n8. Wait for 5 minutes while the module imports.\\n\\n##### Update Az.Storage module\\n\\n_Note: the Az.The accounts module will need to finish its import before the Az.The storage module is updated._\\n\\n1. In the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\"), navigate to [**Azure Automation accounts**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Automation%2FAutomationAccounts \\"Azure Automation Accounts\\").\\n2. Find your Azure Automation account and, click on it, navigate to **Modules** _(under Shared resources)_.\\n3. Select **Browse Gallery**\\n4. Search for: **Az.Storage**\\n5. ![Import  Az.Storage](/uploads/azautomation_gallery_azstorage.png \\" Az.Storage\\")\\n6. Click \'**Az.Storage**\' and select **Select.**\\n7. Set the **runtime** version to: **5.1** & select impor**t**\\n8. Wait for 5 minutes while the module imports.\\n\\n##### Create System Managed Identity\\n\\nNow that the base Modules have been updated, we need to create a System Managed Identity - this Managed Identity will allow the Azure Automation runbook to authenticate to your Azure resources - and, in our example - make changes, such as Disabling or Enabling the SFTP service. This System Managed Identity will need Storage Account Contributor rights.\\n\\n1. In the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\"), navigate to [**Azure Automation accounts**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Automation%2FAutomationAccounts \\"Azure Automation Accounts\\").\\n2. Find your Azure Automation account and click on it; click on **Identity** _(under Account Settings)_\\n3. Select Status to: **On** and select **Save**\\n4. Click on: **Azure role assignments**\\n   1. Select your **Scope** _(in our example, we will go with Storage - to limit what changes this Azure Automation account can make)_\\n   2. Select the **Subscription** and **Storage account** Resource on which you want to disable or enable the SFTP service.\\n   3. For the role, select **Storage Account Contributor**.\\n   4. Click **Save**\\n\\n_You should now see the Azure automation account, listed as having Storage account contributor rights - under your Automation account\'s Access Control (IAM) blade._\\n\\n##### Import Runbook - Set-AzStgFTP.ps1\\n\\nNow that the AzAccounts, Az.Storage modules have been updated, and the Azure Automation account has been given permission - to enable and disable the SFTP service on the storage account- it\'s time to import the Runbook that will make this happen.\\n\\n 1. In the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\"), navigate to [**Azure Automation accounts**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Automation%2FAutomationAccounts \\"Azure Automation Accounts\\").\\n 2. Find your Azure Automation account and, click on it, navigate to **Runbooks** _(under Process Automation)_.\\n 3. Click **+ Create a Runbook**\\n 4. Enter your runbook **name** _(i.e. Set-AzSFTP)_\\n 5. Select the Runbook type as **PowerShell**\\n 6. Select the Runtime version as: **5.1**\\n 7. \\\\[Optional\\\\] Add a description of what this Runbook does and who to contact.\\n 8. Click **Create**\\n 9. Open the newly created blank Runbook, and select **Edit**\\n10. **Copy** the following PowerShell [**script**](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/Azure/blob/main/Azure%20Automation/Set-AzStgSFTP.ps1 \\"Set-AzStgSFTP.ps1\\") into the Edit pane:\\n\\n         param\\n            (\\n                [Parameter(Mandatory=$true,Position = 0, HelpMessage = \'Enter the Azure Resource Group, that contains your Azure Storage account\')]\\n                [string]\\n                $resourceGroupName,\\n            \\n                [Parameter(Position = 1, Mandatory = $true, HelpMessage = \'Enter the Azure Storage account name\')]\\n                [string]\\n                $storageAccountName,\\n            \\n                [Parameter(Mandatory = $true, HelpMessage = \'$True = Enable SFTP & $False = Disable SFTP\')][ValidateSet(\'False\',\'True\')]\\n                $enableSftp\\n            )\\n          \\n              <#\\n            .SYNOPSIS\\n            Disables or enables SFTP support on an Azure Storage Account.\\n            .DESCRIPTION\\n            Disables or enables SFTP support on an Azure Storage Account.

Click **Save**\\n12. Click **Publish**\\n\\n##### Run Runbook - Set-AzStgFTP\\n\\nNow that the Runbook is imported, we need to run it.\\n\\nThe Runbook uses the following parameters:\\n\\n| Parameters | Values |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| resourceGroupName | Enter the name of the Azure Resource Group, that contains your Azure Storage account. |\\n| storageAccountName | Enter the name of your Azure Storage account. |\\n| enableSftp | The following boolean values are accepted: False (Disable SFTP) and True (Enable SFTP). |\\n\\n1. Next, find your Runbook, and select **Start.**\\n2.

The recommended approach for analysing Azure Firewall logs is to set up a Log Analytics Workspace to collect all the data and use Kusto _(KQL)_ queries to check what\'s happening.\\n>\\n> In Azure-Firewall-mon, the idea is to provide an approach much more like Sysinternals Process Monitor or Check Point\'s SmartView, where there is no queries or dashboards that you need to implement first to get working. Still, all events are available as a log stream. In addition, a full-text search at the top of the page lets you quickly filter the content displayed on the screen, helping you understand what is happening right now (or close to present).\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\nAzure-Firewall-mon _(AFM or Azure Firewall Monitor)_ is a custom solution _(currently in a functional beta)_ created by an Italian Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect called: [Nicola Delfino](https://nicolgit.github.io/ \\"Nicola Delfino\\"), its worth mentioning that although a Microsoft CSA makes AFM, **IT IS NOT A SUPPORTED MICROSOFT PRODUCT**.\\n\\nMonitoring Azure Firewall can be a pain - with trawling through logs - using the [Azure Firewall Workbook](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/firewall-workbook?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Monitor logs using Azure Firewall Workbook\\") - helps fill in the gap - especially around the application and network rule traffic. Still, you may want something more straightforward and designed for real-time traffic to assist with in-the-moment troubleshooting.\\n\\nAzure-Firewall-mon is an open-source, [single Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) written in [Angular](https://angular.io/) and hosted on an [Azure WebApp](https://az-firewall-mon.azurewebsites.net \\"az-firewall-mon\\") - so to use this, you don\'t need to deploy to your environment.. add in an Event Hub connection string, and away you go _(there is also a demo mode - so you can see what the experience will be like)_!\\n\\n![az-firewall-mon landing page](/uploads/az-firewall-mon.png \\"az-firewall-mon\\")\\n![az-firewall-mon landing page](/uploads/azfirewallmon.png \\"az-firewall-mon\\")\\n\\n**We can deploy it to an Azure** [**Static Web App**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/static/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\" Static Web Apps\\") **for those who would instead host it in our environment.**\\n\\n> \\"Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full-stack web apps to Azure from a code repository. When you create an Azure Static Web Apps resource, Azure interacts directly with GitHub or Azure DevOps to monitor a branch of your choice. Every time you push commits or accept pull requests into the watched branch, a build is automatically run and your app and API is deployed to Azure.\\"\\n\\n![Azure Static WebApps - Overview](/uploads/azure-static-web-apps-overview.png \\"Azure Static WebApps - Overview\\")\\n\\n### Deployment\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\nToday, we are going to deploy Azure-Firewall-mon into an Azure Static Web App - to do this; we will need the following prerequisites:\\n\\n* A [GitHub](https://github.com/ \\"GitHub\\") account\\n* An [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Do more with less. On Azure.\\") subscription_(with permissions to deploy Event Hub, deploy an Azure Static WebApp, and configure Diagnostics on the Azure Firewall)_\\n* Azure Firewall _(provisioned)_\\n\\n_Note: Also, ensure that your Event Hub is in the same region as your Azure Firewall so that you can use Diagnostics settings. Regarding the Azure Static WebApp - it doesn\'t matter; this is a global service  - and you will be entering the Event Hub listener._\\n\\nWe will use the Azure Portal and a browser to provision the workflow _(however, I will have added Azure Bicep to the bottom of the article for reference)_.\\n\\nThis article - assumes you have basic knowledge of GitHub and Microsoft Azure.\\n\\nFor this demo, I am using a [Hub & Spoke Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke?tabs=cli&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Hub-spoke network topology in Azure\\") topology.\\n\\n![Azure Firewall Monitor - High Level Architecture](/uploads/AzMonArchitecture.png \\"Azure Firewall Monitor - High Level Architecture\\")\\n\\n#### Fork the GitHub repository\\n\\nThe first thing we need to do is clone the Azure-Firewall-mon repository; this repository holds the source control of Azure-Firewall-mon. First, however, we need a clone of it - to use in our Static Web App - this will also allow us to pull down and build the latest changes and updates of the Azure-Firewall-mon tool while having the stability of maintaining your version of the device.\\n\\n1. In your favourite browser of choice, navigate to: [https://github.com/nicolgit/azure-firewall-mon](https://github.com/nicolgit/azure-firewall-mon \\"https://github.com/nicolgit/azure-firewall-mon\\").\\n2.

You can apply tags for individual resources, display show back or ownership and can be used for automation - but what assigning parent/child relationships to your resources?\\n\\n[Tags](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/decision-guides/resource-tagging/?toc=%2Fazure%2Fazure-resource-manager%2Fmanagement%2Ftoc.json&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Resource naming and tagging decision guide\\") work well for most used cases, but there may be times when you want to get a more in-depth view of the service and dependencies - this is where the \\"_cm-resource-parent_\\" tag comes in.\\n\\nIntroduced in [Cost Analysis preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/enable-preview-features-cost-management-labs?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#group-related-resources-in-the-cost-analysis-preview \\"Group related resources in the cost analysis preview\\"), Q3 of 2022, the \'cm-resource-parent tag\' allows you to Group related resources together - to help give you a quick view of the solution\'s total cost in a parent/child relationship. The \'cm\' in the tag stands for: Cost Management.\\n\\n![cm-resource-parent Child Relationship](/uploads/parentchild.png \\"cm-resource-parent Child Relationship\\")\\n\\nTo use the cm-resource-parent tag, you must choose a parent resource _(an example may be an App Service or an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool)._ No changes will be made to this resource, but you need the ResourceID of the resource to apply to Child resources.\\n\\nTo find the ResourceID of the parent resource, you can use the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Azure Portal\\"), by\\n\\n1. **Open** the **resource** that you want to be the parent of.\\n2. Select **Properties** in the resource menu.\\n3. Find the **Resource ID** property and copy its value.\\n\\nYou can easily use PowerShell to find the ResourceID as well:\\n\\n    $ResourceName = \'Parent Resource\'\\n    Get-AzResource -Name $ResourceName | Select-Object ResourceId\\n\\nA resource ID looks like this _(you will need to copy the full thing, this will be used on your child\'s resources)_:\\n\\n    /subscriptions/4501c644-74a3-4bfc-a456-16425eccd2a4/resourceGroups/vm-preprod-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/VM-T01-ip\\n\\nOnce you have the Resource ID of your resource, it is time to tag your Child\'s resources.\\n\\nAs an Azure Tag is a Key/Value pair - the tags will be similar to:\\n\\n| Name | Value |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| cm-resource-parent | /subscriptions/4501c644-74a3-4bfc-a456-16425eccd2a4/resourceGroups/vm-preprod-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/VM-T01-ip |\\n\\nTo apply the ResourceID of the parent resource, you can use the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Azure Portal\\"), by\\n\\n1. **Open** the **resource** you want to be the child of the parent you selected above.\\n2. Click **Tags**\\n3. Add in: **cm-resource-parent** in the value and the resource ID of your parent as a value.\\n\\n_Note: You cannot have a multi-hierarchy, i.e. a Parent, then Child and Child off that - it is purely a Parent and Child relationship at this stage. Also, the Resource ID will change if the Parent resources are moved to another Resource group or subscription._\\n\\nThese Tags can work easily with other cost management tags you may be using _(but you cannot have more than one cm-resource-parent tag)_, so it doesn\'t replace but supplements your visibility. They are supported on any resource that is Tag-capable.\\n\\nYou may have to wait up to a day _(24 hours)_ before the changes are visible in Azure Cost Analysis.\\n\\nI have the [Azure Naming Tool](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/deploy-azure-naming-tool-into-an-azure-webapp-as-a-container/ \\"Azure Naming Tool\\") deployed in my example and would like to see the overall cost; these resources are deployed across multiple resources in the same subscription.\\n\\nChoosing my WebApp as my parent resource, I tagged all child resources _(App Service Plan, Container Registry, Storage Account)_ with the relevant tag and resource ID as seen below:\\n\\n![Azure Portal - Child resource](/uploads/azureportal_cmtags_child.png \\"Azure Portal - Child resource\\")\\n\\nAfter 24 hours, I then went to the [**Cost Analysis (Preview)**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_CostManagement/Menu/\\\\~/costanalysisv3 \\"Cost analysis (preview)\\") and selected **Resources** and could view the current cost of my service after a few days of use.\\n\\n![Azure Cost Analysis](/uploads/azureportal_costanalysis_aznamingtool.png \\"Azure Cost Analysis\\")\\n\\nAnd another example can be seen below - where I have added a Public IP as a child resource of the Azure storage account, which, although the parent in this relationship, is a child in the Azure Naming Tool.\\n\\n![Azure Cost Analysis](/uploads/azureportal_costanalysis_example2.png \\"Azure Cost Analysis\\")\\n\\nAs you can see, the \'cm-resource-parent\' is another way to group related resources of different types from a cost analysis angle; still, in preview, this tag opens up the door for various other initiatives across observability, security stacks etc. \\n\\nAlthough not tested, you also should be able to output the resource ID of your Bicep code and add that as a variable for any resources deployed via Infrastructure as Code.\\n\\nIt\'s worth noting that this feature is still in Preview at the time of this article, so if you incur any bugs or have feature requests, you can use the \'Rate the Cost Analysis Preview\' feature in the Azure Portal to supply feedback to the product teams."},{"id":"misc/how-to-download-a-microsoft-exam-certificate","metadata":{"permalink":"/misc/how-to-download-a-microsoft-exam-certificate","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-07-how-to-download-a-microsoft-exam-certificate.md","title":"How to download or print a Microsoft exam certificate","description":"This was asked in the Microsoft forums; with the change of platform from being able to see and download certificates for the competition of your Microsoft exam with Pearsonvue to the new Microsoft Learn experience, you might find yourself lost when attempting to view (and print) your hard-earned Microsoft certificate!","date":"2022-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Misc","permalink":"/tags/misc"}],"readingTime":0.785,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How to download or print a Microsoft exam certificate","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Misc"],"toc":false,"date":"2022-09-07 00:00:00 +1300","slug":"misc/how-to-download-a-microsoft-exam-certificate"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Application cost analysis in Microsoft Azure with cm-resource-parent tag","permalink":"/azure/application-cost-analysis-in-microsoft-azure-with-cm-resource-parent-tag"},"nextItem":{"title":"InternalServerError when deploying Azure Firewall","permalink":"/azure/internalservererror-when-deploying-azure-firewall"}},"content":"This was asked in the Microsoft forums; with the change of platform from being able to see and download certificates for the competition of your Microsoft exam with Pearsonvue to the new Microsoft Learn experience, you might find yourself lost when attempting to view _(and print)_ your hard-earned Microsoft certificate!\\n\\nThe certificate format has also been refreshed.\\n\\n**Old**\\n\\n![Microsoft certificate](/uploads/001-mtc-cert_old.png \\"Microsoft certificate\\")\\n\\n**New**\\n\\n![Microsoft certificate](/uploads/mslearn_certificateformat.png \\"Microsoft certificate\\")\\n\\nTo view and print your certificate:\\n\\n1.

If you aim to use this in a Production scenario, functionality and services may change. This also means there are current_ [_regional restrictions_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#regional-availability \\"Regional availability\\")_, and Azure Private DNS Resolver is not currently available in all regions. Also bear in mind the [cost](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/dns/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) of this service._\\n\\n#### So what is Azure DNS Resolver?\\n\\n> Azure DNS private resolver is a cloud-native, highly available, and DevOps-friendly service. It provides a simple, zero-maintenance, reliable, and secure Domain Name System (DNS) service to resolve and conditionally forward DNS queries from a virtual network, on-premises, and to other target DNS servers without the need to create and manage a custom DNS solution. Resolve DNS names hosted in Azure Private DNS Zones from on-premises networks as well as DNS queries for your own domain names. This will make your DNS infrastructure work privately and seamlessly across on-premises networks and enable key hybrid networking scenarios.\\n\\n![Azure Private DNS Resolver](/uploads/azureprivatednsresolver.png \\"Azure Private DNS Resolver\\")\\n\\nCustomers will no longer need to provision IaaS-based solutions on their virtual networks to resolve names registered on Azure Private DNS Zones and can do conditional forwarding of domains back to on-premises, across multi-cloud providers, and public DNS servers.\\n\\nThis solution can work with your Azure ExpressRoute, Azure VPN, or Azure Bastion setup.\\n\\n![Azure Private DNS Resolver](/uploads/dns-private-resolver.png \\"Azure Private DNS Resolver\\")\\n\\n#### Inbound or Outbound?\\n\\nName resolution queries for Azure workloads from the on-premises network are conditionally forwarded to the Azure DNS private resolver inbound endpoint, which enables you to perform name resolution of workloads registered on Azure Private DNS Zones from on-premises.\\n\\n| Endpoint          | Blurb                                                                                                                                     |\\n| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| Inbound Endpoint  | Azure DNS private resolver inbound endpoint that receives the name resolution request from Azure & on-premises network and resolve names. |\\n| Outbound Endpoint | Azure DNS private resolver outbound endpoint conditionally forwards the request to on-premises or other target DNS servers.               |\\n\\nThe Azure DNS private resolver inbound endpoint has a private IP that is part of a subnet where the endpoint has been created. The IP address of the DNS private resolver inbound endpoint is then set as a DNS server on the on-premises network.\\n\\nAzure DNS private resolver outbound endpoint conditionally forwards the request to on-premises or other target DNS servers.\\n\\n**Today, we will connect to private endpoints to concentrate on the Inbound functionality of Azure Private DNS Resolver.**\\n\\n### Deployment\\n\\nTo deploy Azure Private DNS Resolver, we will need a few things.\\n\\n* A Virtual Network\\n* A [subnet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-overview#subnet-restrictions \\"Subnet restrictions\\") dedicated to resolving DNS queries _(/28)_\\n* A private endpoint _(i.e. Storage Account, SQL Database)_ is linked to the virtual network.\\n\\n#### Deploy DNS Private Resolver\\n\\n_I assume you already have a Virtual Network tied to your Virtual Network gateway as part of the \'_[_Point to Site VPN_](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/create-azure-point-to-site-vpn-using-azure-active-directory-authentication/ \\"Create Azure Point to Site VPN using Microsoft Entra ID authentication \\")_\' setup._\\n\\n 1. Open the **Azure Portal**\\n 2. Click on **+ Create a resource**\\n 3. Type in: **DNS Private Resolver**\\n 4. ![Azure DNS Private Resolver](/uploads/azureportal_creatednsprivateresolver.png \\"Azure DNS Private Resolver\\")\\n 5. Click **Create**\\n 6. Select your **Subscription**\\n 7. Select your **Resource Group** _(I recommend placing the DNS Private Resolver in the same resource group as your Virtual Network - but place this service in a Resource Group that makes sense for your environment, i.e. shared services or a specific network team resource group)_\\n 8. Type in a **name** for your DNS Private Resolver _(this is a regional service, but the name does not need a globally unique )_\\n 9. **Select** your **region** _(this needs to be the same region as the Virtual Network)_\\n10. Select your **Virtual Network** _(the same Virtual Network that has your Virtual Network Gateway for the Point to Site VPN and your Private endpoints)_\\n11. ![Create Azure Private DNS Resolver](/uploads/azureportal_creatednsprivateresolverinitialpane.png \\"Create Azure Private DNS Resolver\\")\\n12. Click **Next: Inbound Endpoints >**\\n13. Now its time to add our Inbound Endpoint and create the Private DNS Resolver Subnet, click **+ Add an endpoint**\\n14. Type in your **endpoint name** (_for example, InboundEndpoint)_\\n15. If you have already created a subnet, select it - else, click **Create New**\\n16. Enter in your subnet name and address range\\n17. Click **Save**\\n18. ![Private DNS Resolver create subnet](/uploads/azureportal_creatednsprivateresolversubnet.png \\"Private DNS Resolver create subnet\\")\\n19. Click **Review + Create**\\n20. Click **Create**\\n\\n#### Adjust Point to Site DNS\\n\\nNow that the DNS Resolver has been created, with an inbound endpoint, allowing the lookup of private endpoints, we need to add the Private Resolver DNS relay to our point-to-site VPN configuration; first, we need the newly created private IP of the inbound endpoint.\\n\\n 1. Navigate to the [**DNS Private Resolver**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Network%2FdnsResolvers \\"DNS Private Resolvers\\") in the Azure Portal\\n 2. **Open** your DNS Private **Resolver service**\\n 3. Click on **Inbound Endpoints**\\n 4. Make a note of the **private IP** of your inbound endpoint.\\n 5. ![Private DNS Resolver](/uploads/azureportal_creatednsprivateresolverinboundendpointip.png \\"Private DNS Resolver\\")\\n 6. Now that the Private Inbound resolver has been configured, we need to add the DNS relay into our Azure VPN configuration so that our DNS queries will respond with a private endpoint; you will need to modify the \'[azurevpnconfig.xml](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/about-vpn-profile-download?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#generate \\"Generate profile files\\")\' file and reimport the VPN.\\n 7. Right-click \'azurevpnconfig.xml\' and edit in Notepad or Visual Studio Code\\n 8. Under: </serverlist>\\n 9. **Add** _(replace the IP listed below with the IP of your Inbound endpoint copied earlier)_:\\n\\n        <clientconfig>\\n        <dnsservers>\\n        <dnsserver>10.0.18.4</dnsserver>\\n        </dnsservers>\\n        </clientconfig>\\n10. **Save** and **reimport** to the Azure VPN Client\\n11. Once connected, ping a resource behind a private endpoint, and you should get the private IP of that resource back and should be able to connect to that resource privately.\\n12. ![Azure Private DNS Resolver ping](/uploads/azurevpn_testprivateendpoint.png \\"Azure Private DNS Resolver ping\\")\\n\\nAny future or current private endpoints linked to the same Virtual Network will instantly be accessible without additional changes on the Azure VPN client.\\nIf you have a Hub & Spoke topology, then you may place the DNS Private Resolver in the HUB, then use [forwarding rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-get-started-portal?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#link-your-forwarding-ruleset-to-the-second-virtual-network) to link to other peered VNETs.\\n\\n### Additional resources\\n\\nThe third-party resources below include reading and learning about the Azure Private DNS Resolver.\\n\\n* [Quickstart: Create an Azure private DNS Resolver using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-get-started-portal?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Quickstart: Create an Azure private DNS Resolver using the Azure portal\\")\\n* [Intro to Azure DNS Private Resolver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-dns-private-resolver/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Intro to Azure DNS Private Resolver\\")\\n* [Azure DNS Private Resolver - MicroHack](https://github.com/dawlysd/azure-dns-private-resolver-microhack \\"Azure DNS Private Resolver - MicroHack\\")\\n* My Azure Private DNS Resolver Bicep export for reference:\\n\\n        param dnsResolvers_PrivateDNSResolver_name string = \'PrivateDNSResolver\'\\n        param virtualNetworks_vnettest_externalid string = \'/subscriptions/57627713-eff2-44fa-a546-a2c8fde3c6e3/resourceGroups/pointtositetest/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnettest\'\\n\\n        resource dnsResolvers_PrivateDNSResolver_name_resource \'Microsoft.Network/dnsResolvers@2020-04-01-preview\' = {\\n        name: dnsResolvers_PrivateDNSResolver_name\\n        location: \'australiaeast\'\\n        properties: {\\n        virtualNetwork: {\\n          id: virtualNetworks_vnettest_externalid\\n        }\\n      }\\n        }\\n                resource dnsResolvers_PrivateDNSResolver_name_InboundEndpoint \'Microsoft.Network/dnsResolvers/inboundEndpoints@2020-04-01-preview\' = {\\n      parent: dnsResolvers_PrivateDNSResolver_name_resource\\n      name: \'InboundEndpoint\'\\n      location: \'australiaeast\'\\n          }\\n        ]\\n      }\\n        }"},{"id":"azure/ims-payroll-not-opening-as-a-published-application-in-azure-virtual-desktop","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/ims-payroll-not-opening-as-a-published-application-in-azure-virtual-desktop","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-23-ims-payroll-not-opening-as-a-published-application-in-azure-virtual-desktop.md","title":"IMS Payroll not opening as a published application in Azure Virtual Desktop","description":"Azure Virtual Desktop allows you to access an entire desktop or a published application with shortcuts and an appearance like it was running locally;

it didn\'t seem to open for the user, whether as a published application or in the Full Desktop.\\n\\nThe symptoms were that once the user clicked on the icon, it would appear to open _(visible on the Taskbar)_, but there was no window, and when you hovered over the preview thumbnail, it was blank. The cursor also appeared to be active with a circle, indicating it was trying to open.\\n\\nEven if you don\'t have IMS Payroll, you may experience applications with a similar experience, and hopefully, this article will help point you in the right direction.\\n\\n![Azure Virtual Desktop - Published Application](/uploads/imspayroll_avdpublishedapp.png)\\n\\nOne noticeable difference we found in our testing - was that it opened for us and other users using different accounts.\\n\\nAfter some discovery, we discovered that the user had gone to another branch office site and used a different monitor setup, and IMS Payroll was out of drawing range. Usually, windows would be able to snap this back into view; however, after comparing the registry keys for our user vs the user who had the issue, we discovered that IMS Payroll sets the location in the user registry.\\n\\n* Registry Key location: **\\\\\\\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\\\\\IMS Payroll Partner\\\\\\\\Layout**\\n\\nIn our case, the settings were as follows:\\n\\n    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\\n    \\n    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\IMS Payroll Partner\\\\Layout]\\n    \\"Left\\"=\\"684\\"\\n    \\"Top\\"=\\"310\\"\\n    \\"Height\\"=\\"713\\"\\n    \\"Width\\"=\\"1127\\"\\n    \\"StatusBar\\"=\\"1\\"\\n    \\"ActiveHelp\\"=\\"0\\"\\n    \\"EmployeePage\\"=\\"0\\"\\n    \\"PayrollPage\\"=\\"5\\"\\n    \\"CompanyPage\\"=\\"1\\"\\n    \\"SkipWelcome\\"=\\"1\\"\\n    \\"SkinName\\"=\\"lfUltraFlat\\"\\n    \\"LastPage\\"=\\"6\\"\\n\\nFor the users who couldn\'t see IMS Payroll, their settings looked more like this:\\n\\n    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\\n    \\n    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\IMS Payroll Partner\\\\Layout]\\n    \\"Left\\"=\\"-1444\\"\\n    \\"Top\\"=\\"310\\"\\n    \\"Height\\"=\\"713\\"\\n    \\"Width\\"=\\"1127\\"\\n    \\"StatusBar\\"=\\"1\\"\\n    \\"ActiveHelp\\"=\\"0\\"\\n    \\"EmployeePage\\"=\\"0\\"\\n    \\"PayrollPage\\"=\\"5\\"\\n    \\"CompanyPage\\"=\\"1\\"\\n    \\"SkipWelcome\\"=\\"1\\"\\n    \\"SkinName\\"=\\"lfUltraFlat\\"\\n    \\"LastPage\\"=\\"6\\"\\n\\nThe difference was that the Left entry had moved the Window too far, left out of view, so it could not be seen by the user when opening as a published app or on a Desktop.\\n\\nAfter the **Left entry was changed from -1444 to 684**. IMS became visible again as a published application and on the Full Desktop.\\n\\nDue to the hard-coded user registry entries, this specific issue would have occurred regardless of Azure Virtual Desktop, running in a Terminal Services environment, or even locally, when working with different monitor setups.\\n\\n_Note: Some applications may have configuration files stored in the user\'s AppData folders instead of the registry; if in doubt, raise a support ticket with the application vendor._"},{"id":"/2022/08/18/microsoft-azure-cost-optimization-tasks","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022/08/18/microsoft-azure-cost-optimization-tasks","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-18-microsoft-azure-cost-optimization-tasks.md","title":"Microsoft Azure - Operational Cost Optimization Tasks","description":"The Microsoft Azure platform is not a set-and-forget ecosystem like doing service on your car!","date":"2022-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":15.125,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"date":"2022-08-18 00:00:00 +1200","title":"Microsoft Azure - Operational Cost Optimization Tasks","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"/uploads/cost_pillar_overview.png"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"IMS Payroll not opening as a published application in Azure Virtual Desktop","permalink":"/azure/ims-payroll-not-opening-as-a-published-application-in-azure-virtual-desktop"},"nextItem":{"title":"Connect to Azure SQL Database in a Jupyter Notebook using Python","permalink":"/2022/08/17/connect-to-azure-sql-database-in-a-jupyter-notebook-using-python"}},"content":"The [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Microsoft Azure\\") platform is not a set-and-forget ecosystem like doing service on your car!\\n\\nThere are no one-size-fits when it comes to cost optimization, but some general tasks can be done or considered on a Monthly/Quarterly/Annual basis to keep on top of the resources you are running in Azure and to keep them lean.\\n\\n#### Overview\\n\\nAlthough Microsoft takes a lot of traditional infrastructure management and security concerns off your hand, you are still responsible for the spending and ensuring the value of the technologies and services you consume match your business goals and agility.\\n\\nToday we are going to go back to basics and look at the [Cost Optimization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#cost-optimization \\"Cost optimization\\") pillar of the Microsoft [Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework\\").\\n\\n> \u201cThe cost optimization pillar provides principles for balancing business goals with budget justification to create a cost-effective workload while avoiding capital-intensive solutions. Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies.\u201d\\n>\\n> \u201cUse the pay-as-you-go strategy for your architecture, and invest in scaling out, rather than delivering a large investment-first version. Consider opportunity costs in your architecture and the balance between first-mover advantage versus fast follow.\u201d\\n\\nThe right governance and oversight can help prevent Cloud sprawl and wasted consumption costs.\\n\\nTo help get you started, I have put together a list of some optimization opportunities, that should be run regularly, items such as reviewing unassociated public IPs should be done Monthly _(along with Azure Advisor checks)_, and [Azure Reservation reviews](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"What are Azure Reservations?\\") at least quarterly.\\n\\n> **_This is not an exhaustive list_**, and the use of [Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"What is Azure Policy?\\") and [Azure Advisor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Introduction to Azure Advisor\\") help supplement these tasks.\\n>\\n> If you have other tasks that you run, feel free to share them with the community in the page comments below.\\n\\nThe [Microsoft Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Overview of Microsoft Graph\\") and [KQL queries](https://luke.geek.nz/azure-resource-graph-explorer-and-the-powershell-azure-resource-graph \\"Azure Resource Graph Explorer and the PowerShell Azure Resource Graph \\") can also be used in conjunction with PowerShell to pull recommendations straight out of Advisor, which can then be fed into reports, and the use of community tools such as the [Azure Optimization Engine](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/azure-optimization-engine \\"Azure Optimization Engine \\") cannot be undervalued.\\n\\n#### Design\\n\\n![Azure - Monitor & optimize](/uploads/cost_pillar_overview.png \\"Azure - Monitor & optimize\\")\\n\\n##### Keep within the cost constraints\\n\\nEvery design choice has cost implications. Before choosing an architectural pattern, Azure service, or a price model for the service, consider the budget constraints set by the company. As part of the design, identify acceptable boundaries on scale, redundancy, and performance against cost. After estimating the initial cost, set budgets and alerts at different scopes to measure the cost.\\n\\nOne of the cost drivers can be unrestricted resources. These resources typically need to scale and consume more cost to meet demand.\\n\\n##### Aim for scalable costs\\n\\nA key benefit of the cloud is the ability to scale dynamically. The workload cost should scale linearly with demand.\\n\\nYou can save costs through automatic scaling. First, consider the usage metrics and performance to determine the number of instances. Then, choose smaller instances for a highly variable workload and scale out to get the required level of performance rather than up. This choice will enable you to make your cost calculations and estimates granular.\\n\\n##### Pay for the consumption\\n\\nAdopt a leasing model instead of owning infrastructure. Azure offers many SaaS and PaaS resources that simplify the overall architecture. The cost of hardware, software, development, operations, security, and data centre space is included in the pricing model. Also, choose pay-as-you-go over fixed pricing. That way, you\'re charged for only what you use as a consumer.\\n\\n##### Right resources, the right size\\n\\nChoose the right resources aligned with business goals and can handle the workload\'s performance.\\n\\nAn inappropriate or misconfigured service can impact the cost.\\n\\nFor example, building a multi-region service when the service levels don\'t require high availability or geo-redundancy will increase cost without any reasonable business justification. Specific infrastructure resources are delivered as fix-sized building blocks. Ensure that these blocks are adequately sized to meet capacity demand and deliver expected outcomes.\\n\\n##### Monitor and optimize\\n\\nTreat cost monitoring and optimization as a process rather than a point-in-time activity. Conduct regular cost reviews and measure and forecast the capacity needs so that you can provision resources dynamically and scale with demand. Review the cost management recommendations and take action.\\n\\nToday, we will focus on **Monitor and optimize**.\\n\\n#### Review Underutilized Resources\\n\\nOptimize and improve efficiency by identifying idle and underutilized resources across the Azure ecosystem.\\n\\n##### Review Azure App Service Plans\\n\\nReview [Azure App Service Plans](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Web%2FserverFarms \\"Azure Portal - App Service plan\\") to determine if:\\n\\n1. The Azure App Service Plan is \u2018Standard\u2019 or \u2018Premium\u2019 pricing and has an associated application.\\n2. If the Azure App Service is getting utilized _(by looking at the Metrics/CPU)_ and doesn\u2019t need to be downscaled to a smaller plan.\\n\\n##### Review shutdown workloads\\n\\nBecause you pay for Azure Resources as \u2018Pay As You Go\u2019, a quick win can be to review [Virtual Machines](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachines \\"Azure Portal - Virtual Machines\\") to determine if the workload needs to be 24/7!\\n\\nFor example, you have automation configured to automatically start up and shut down workloads based on the following schedule: 7 AM Start \u2013 7 PM Stop _(& off Weekends)_.\\n\\nYou can add servers to this automated schedule by adding the following Tag to the Virtual Machine or trigger automation when a workload is \u2018Shutdown\u2019 and not deallocated; see my article on \\"[Turn on an Azure Virtual Machine using Azure Automation](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/turn-on-a-azure-virtual-machine-using-azure-automation/ \\"Turn on a Azure Virtual Machine using Azure Automation \\")\\" for a potential place to start.\\n\\n##### Review Azure Advisor\\n\\nThe Azure Advisor is an inbuilt tool critical to optimizing the Azure Environment. The [Azure Advisor](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Expert/AdvisorMenuBlade/Cost \\"Azure Portal - Azure Advisor\\") needs to be reviewed for Cost recommendations.\\n\\n1. The Azure Advisor will recommend Reserved Instances.\\n2. The Azure Advisor will recommend if a Virtual Machine runs on a VM size GREATER than what it needs _(based on CPU utilization under 5% in the last 14 days)_. If the Azure Advisor reports an overprovisioned machine, you need to investigate its use and resize it to a more suitable size.\\n\\n##### Review Azure SQL Databases\\n\\nReview [Azure SQL Databases](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Sql%2Fservers%2Fdatabases \\"Azure Portal - Azure SQL databases\\") to determine if:\\n\\n1. The SQL Database Pricing Tier is \u2018Standard\u2019 and uses the DTUs (usually found by looking at the Compute utilization on the databases); if not, downsize the DTU limit.\\n2. Check Geo-Replication to ensure that the SQL Database is not replicating across Regions if it doesn\u2019t need to be.\\n\\n#### Review Azure Reserved Instances\\n\\nAzure reserved instances significantly reduce costs\u2014up to 72 per cent compared to pay-as-you-go prices\u2014with one-year or three-year terms on Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs). What\'s more, you can now improve budgeting and forecasting with a single upfront payment (i.e. Pay for a VM Upfront for 1/3 Year or 5 Years), making it easy to calculate your investments. Or lower your upfront cash outflow with monthly payment options at no additional cost.\\n\\n![Azure Reserved Instance](/uploads/azure-ri.png \\"Azure Reserved Instance\\")\\n\\nThe Azure Advisor is an inbuilt tool critical to optimizing the Azure Environment. The Azure Advisor needs to be reviewed for Reserved Instance recommendations.\\n\\n1. When reviewing Reserved Instances, you need to take into consideration:\\n2. What workloads are they used for?\\n3. Is there a project that may replace or resize the workloads next year?\\n4. Who is paying for the workloads?\\n\\n#### Review unused files and VHDs\\n\\nSave Azure costs by cleaning up unused VHDs in your Azure storage. Azure stores Azure Virtual Machine OS and data disks in Azure storage accounts.\\n\\nWhen a VM is deleted from the Azure portal, the underlying OS and data disks may not get deleted. Such disks continue to consume Azure storage and account for the cost of storing them. These disks are called Orphaned Disks.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, some Virtual Machines with unmanaged disks will keep the VHDs around when deleted.\\n\\nUsing a PowerShell [script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/find-unattached-disks?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Find and delete unattached Azure managed and unmanaged disks\\") _(provided by Microsoft),_ you can report on any disks that are not in use by a VM and then delete them.\\n\\n_Note: Be VERY cautious doing this; solutions such as Citrix and Azure Image Builder use unmanaged disks to create new Session hosts, etc., so context is key._\\n\\nWith the Azure Storage accounts using Blob data \u2013 such as Diagnostic Accounts, it is a good idea to implement [Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/lifecycle-management-overview?tabs=azure-portal&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle\\") on the storage accounts, so we are only retaining recent and relevant data.\\n\\n![Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Management](/uploads/azureblogstglifecyclemgmnt.PNG \\"Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Management\\")\\n\\nThe lifecycle management policy lets you:\\n\\n1. Transition blobs to a cooler storage tier _(hot to cool, hot to archive, or cool to archive)_ to optimize for performance and cost\\n2. Delete blobs at the end of their lifecycles\\n3. Define rules to be run once per day at the storage account level.\\n\\n#### Review budgets\\n\\nBudgets in Cost Management help you plan for and drive organizational accountability. With budgets, you can account for the Azure services you consume or subscribe to during a specific period.\\n\\nBudgets help you inform others about their spending to proactively manage costs and monitor how spending progresses over time.\\n\\nWhen the budget thresholds you\'ve created are exceeded, notifications are triggered. None of your resources is affected, and your consumption isn\'t stopped; however, you can use Budget alerts as a trigger to run Azure Logic Apps or Functions to automate the shutdown and resize resources. You can use budgets to compare and track spending as you analyze costs.\\n\\n![Azure Budget](/uploads/azure_budget.png)\\n\\nEnsure Azure Budget notifications are configured to email Product Owners or other Stakeholders once a Resource Group or Subscription reaches a specific threshold.\\n\\nThis is set up in the Azure Portal, on the Resource Group under Budgets, and set to email the Application Owner.\\n\\nExamples of budgets that could be configured:\\n\\nGenerally, I recommend that three budgets should be configured to give enough notice:\\n\\n* 50%\\n* 60%\\n* 70%\\n\\n#### Review Tags\\n\\nYou apply tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name \\"Environment\\" and the value \\"Production\\" to all the resources in production.\\n\\nTags can be used to determine things like:\\n\\n* Who to bill?\\n* Who supports it?\\n\\n![Azure Portal - Tags](/uploads/operrationaltasksazuretags.png \\"Azure Portal - Tags\\")\\n\\nThe right tags can mean that the right owners get charged internally and have more ownership of their resource costs. Examples below:\\n\\n| Tag Name | Value | Comment |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Dept | Finance | Name of the department who owns the resources. |\\n| Environment | UAT | What environment the Resource is used for such as Production, UAT and Development |\\n| Application Owner | Luke Murray | The name of the Product Owner for the service sitting inside the Resource Group |\\n| Support Team | Platform Team | What team is responsible for the resources/site for support reasons |\\n| Billing Code | Operational | Purchase order or project billing code |\\n\\nFor further examples and a base tagging convention, check out a blog article I wrote on [Microsoft Azure Tagging conventions](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/microsoft-azure-tagging-conventions/ \\"Microsoft Azure Tagging Conventions \\").\\n\\n#### Review Hub (Hybrid Use Benefit)\\n\\nThe [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-benefit/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure Hybrid Benefit\\") is a pricing benefit for customers with Software Assurance licenses, which helps maximize the value of existing on-premises Windows Server and/or SQL Server license investments when migrating to Azure.\\n\\nEligible customers can save up to 40% on Azure Virtual Machines _(infrastructure as a service, or IaaS)_, and save up to 55% on Azure SQL Database _(platform as a service, or PaaS)_ and SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines _(IaaS)_ with Azure Hybrid Benefit, which increases to up to 80% when combined with Azure Reserved Instances.\\n\\n![Azure - Hybrid Use Benefit](/uploads/operationaltasks_hub.png \\"Azure - Hybrid Use Benefit\\")\\n\\nTo verify if a server is using the Azure Hybrid Benefit, Log in to the Azure Portal and navigate to the Virtual Machine Blade. Make sure that the: OS Licensing Benefit column is selected.\\n\\nIf a Virtual Machine Already has HUB, it will have: The azure hybrid benefit listed in the column, and any non-supported workloads _(such as Linux)_ will have \u2018Not Supported\u2019.\\n\\nIf any are eligible for HUB, click on the Virtual Machine\u2026\\n\\n1. Click the **Configuration blade**\\n2. Select **Licensing, Already have a Windows server license?**\\n3. **Yes** and **Save**\\n\\n_Note: This is a non-intrusive change that will take effect on the billing immediately and doesn\u2019t cause any impact on the Virtual Machine._\\n\\n#### Review Backups\\n\\n[Azure Backup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure Backup\\") is simple because it\u2019s built into the platform. It has one-click backup support for SQL databases and virtual machines running in Azure.\\n\\nAzure Backup is cost-effective and less complex than other cloud backup solutions while keeping your data safe from ransomware and human errors. Sometimes there will be workloads backed up to migrate, test, or clone, and you no longer need to retain the data.\\n\\n> Note: This can be a tricky one as you will need to talk to product owners to confirm the workloads were just Dev/Test workloads, and not required, there may be legal implications for keeping workloads in the backup. But if someone stood up something to play with, particularly in a Sandbox or Development subscription there may not be a reason to keep it around.\\n\\nLog in to the Azure Portal and navigate the [Recovery Services Vault](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.RecoveryServices%2Fvaults \\"Azure Portal - Recovery Services\\") page. Navigate to each one and click on:\\n\\nBackup:\\n\\n1. Under **Usage**, click on **Backup Items**\\n2. Click on **Azure Virtual Machines**\\n3. **Sort** the **Backup** items by **Latest Restore Point** _(so the older restore points are at the top)_\\n\\n   Using the Latest Restore Point as a guide, IF any servers can have their Backups deleted:\\n4. Click on the **Name** of the Backup Item\\n5. Click on **Stop Backup**\\n6. Select **Delete Backup Data** _(this is non-reversible)_\\n7. Type in the name of the **Backup Item** and select **Stop Backup**\\n\\n#### Review unused Public IPs\\n\\nPublic IP addresses allow Internet resources to communicate inbound to Azure resources. Public IP addresses enable Azure resources to communicate to the Internet and public-facing Azure services.\\n\\nThis is also a great opportunity to inspect what Public IP addresses you have and make sure some resources have public IPs that does not need to be assigned! Tip setup an Azure Policy that prevents the creation of Public IPs.\\n\\nThe address is dedicated to the resource until it\u2019s unassigned by you. A resource without a public IP assigned can communicate outbound. Azure dynamically assigns an available IP address that isn\u2019t dedicated to the resource.\\n\\n![Azure Portal - Public IP Address](/uploads/operationaltasks_pip.png \\"Azure Portal - Public IP Address\\")\\n\\nWhen resources get created, sometimes they will create a Public IP; these can be removed as part of the build but left in the Resource Groups.\\n\\nWe want to remove unattached Public IP to save money.\\n\\n_Note: In some cases, the Product Owner may need to be consulted before any changes are made, as some of the resources may be inflight projects or required._\\n\\n1. Log in to the **Azure Portal** and navigate to the [Public IP Addresses](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Network%2FPublicIpAddresses \\"Azure Portal - Public IP Address\\") blade\\n2. Look in the \u2018**Associated to**\u2019 column, and if not required, click on the **Public IP**\\n3. Click **Delete**\\n\\n#### Review Azure Storage Accounts\\n\\nAn Azure storage account contains all your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. Your Azure storage account\'s data is durable, highly available, secure, and massively scalable.\\n\\nGeneral-purpose storage accounts may be configured for either of the following performance tiers:\\n\\n* A standard performance tier for storing blobs, files, tables, queues, and Azure virtual machine disks.\\n* A premium performance tier for storing unmanaged virtual machine disks. If a Storage account is Premium but only needs to be Standard _(or LRS instead of ZRS)_, this can save some money.\\n\\nNote: In some cases, the Product Owner may need to be consulted before any changes are made, as some of the resources may be inflight projects or required.\\n\\n1. Log in to the **Azure Portal** and navigate to the [**Storage Account**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts \\"Azure Portal - Storage account\\") blade\\n2. Click on **Manage View**, **Edit Columns**, and add in: **SKU**\\n3. **Review** the **Premium** Storage **Accounts** and determine if any accounts need to be downsized to Standard\\n4. To **change**, click on the **Storage Account**\\n5. Click on **Configuration** and change from **Premium** to **Standard**\\n\\nYou can also look at the Replication. Does that Storage Account need to be Geo-Redundant if the rest of the application that uses it isn\u2019t? Can the storage account be changed to Standard during off-hours or non-peak?\\n\\n#### - Download the PDF version of these Tasks\\n\\nFinally, if you prefer this in a more PDF/Visual format - you can download a PDF version of this directly from my Github \\"[here](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/presentations/blob/main/2022/Microsoft%20Azure%20-%20Cost%20Optimization_1.0.pdf \\"Azure Cost Optimization PDF\\")\\".\\n\\n#### - Azure Operational Checklist table\\n\\nThis is a very quick example of what an Azure Operational Checklist could look like; if you record what tasks you do, you can look at further automation around implementation and reporting.\\n\\n| **Azure Checklist**                 | ****   | **** | ****             |\\n|-------------------------------------|--------|------|------------------|\\n| **Action**                          | **Status** | **Date** | **Note/Opportunity** |\\n| **Review Azure App Service Plans**  |        |      |                  |\\n| **Review shutdown workloads**       |        |      |                  |\\n| **Review Azure Advisor**            |        |      |                  |\\n| **Review Azure SQL Databases**      |        |      |                  |\\n| **Review Azure Reserved Instances** |        |      |                  |\\n| **Review unused files and VHDs**    |        |      |                  |\\n| **Review budgets**                  |        |      |                  |\\n| **Review Tags**                     |        |      |                  |\\n| **Review Hub (Hybrid Use Benefit)** |        |      |                  |\\n| **Review Backups**                  |        |      |                  |\\n| **Review unused Public IPs**        |        |      |                  |\\n| **Review Azure Storage Accounts**   |        |      |                  |"},{"id":"/2022/08/17/connect-to-azure-sql-database-in-a-jupyter-notebook-using-python","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022/08/17/connect-to-azure-sql-database-in-a-jupyter-notebook-using-python","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-17-connect-to-azure-sql-database-in-a-jupyter-notebook-using-python.md","title":"Connect to Azure SQL Database in a Jupyter Notebook using Python","description":"Jupyter Notebooks, commonly used by Data Scientists and Students, allow you to run code, such as Python and PowerShell, inside a Notebook format and display the output inside the notebook; this is useful for teaching a subject or displaying up-to-date information.","date":"2022-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":2.405,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"date":"2022-08-17 00:00:00 +1200","title":"Connect to Azure SQL Database in a Jupyter Notebook using Python","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":false,"header":{"teaser":"/uploads/juptyer_notebook.png"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Microsoft Azure - Operational Cost Optimization Tasks","permalink":"/2022/08/18/microsoft-azure-cost-optimization-tasks"},"nextItem":{"title":"Create a Public Holidays API using Microsoft Azure","permalink":"/2022/08/09/create-a-public-holidays-api-using-microsoft-azure"}},"content":"[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/ \\"Jupyter\\") Notebooks, commonly used by Data Scientists and Students, allow you to run code, such as Python and PowerShell, inside a Notebook format and display the output inside the notebook; this is useful for teaching a subject or displaying up-to-date information.\\n\\nI am not a python or Jupyter expert, so this article will be brief on how I was able to connect to an Azure SQL Database using Microsoft Entra ID authentication and run a query.\\n\\nTo run a Jupyter Notebook, you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution \\"Anaconda\\") and then use that to download Juypter to run the notebooks from a locally _(or server)_ hosted web-based interface.\\n\\nHowever, today I will be using Visual Studio Code with the [Jupyter extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks \\" Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code \\") on a windows endpoint.\\n\\nMake sure you install:\\n\\n* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/ \\"Python\\")\\n* [pyodbc](https://pypi.org/project/pyodbc/ \\"pyodbc \\") library\\n* [Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server \\"Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server\\") _(has to be v17 or newer to support Microsoft Entra ID authentication)_.\\n* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ \\"Visual Studio Code\\") + [Jupyter extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks \\" Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code\\")\\n\\n_Note: Jupyter notebook extensions end in \'*.ipynb\'._\\n\\nOnce all the prerequisites are installed, it\'s time to create the Notebook.\\n\\n1.

Could I create and query my API using Microsoft Azure services? You can!\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\n> Today we will create a base Public Holidays API using several Microsoft Azure serverless services, such as Azure Function, Azure Storage Account and API Management.\\n\\n_Note: As this is a demonstration, I will be using a_ [_Consumption-based Azure Function_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure Functions hosting options\\") _and Azure storage account, and although it is a good place to start - depending on your requirements, you may be better off with Azure Function Premium Plan to avoid cold-start times, and if you need a high amount of requests and writes (GET and POSTs) and resiliency, then replace the Storage account table with a_ [_Cosmos DB_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure Cosmos DB\\")_._\\n\\nThe solution will be made up of the following:\\n\\n| Azure Service | Name | Plan | Note |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Application Insights | ai-nzPublicHolidays-prd-ae |  |  |\\n| Azure API Management | apims-publicholidays-prd-ae | Developer (No SLA) |  |\\n| Azure Function | func-nzpublicHolidays-prd-ae | Function App - Consumption |  |\\n| Azure Storage Account | funcnzpublicholidaystgac | StorageV2 (general purpose v2) - Locally-redundant storage (LRS) | Contains \'PublicHolidays\' table |\\n| Azure Storage Account | rgnzpublicholidayspb4ed | Storage (general purpose v1)  - Locally-redundant storage (LRS) | Contains Azure Functions App Files |\\n| Resource Group | rg-publicholidays-prd-ae |  | Resource Group - containing above resources. |\\n\\n![Azure Resource Group - Diagram](/uploads/api_resourcegroupazviz.png \\"Azure Resource Group - Diagram\\")\\n\\n#### Pre-requisites\\n\\n* An Azure subscription _(with at least Contributor rights to a Resource Group)_.\\n* Azure PowerShell modules _(_[_Az.Accounts_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.accounts/?view=azps-8.2.0&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Az.Accounts\\")_,_ [_Az.Storage_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.storage/?view=azps-8.2.0&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Az.Storage\\") _&_ [_AzTables_](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzTable/ \\"AzTable\\")_)_\\n\\n_Note: AzTables is not part of the standard Az PowerShell module set and is a separate module you will need to install (Install-Module AzTables)._\\n\\nWe will use a mix of the Azure Portal and PowerShell to deploy this solution from start to finish; you can find the source data and code directly in the GitHub repository here: [lukemurraynz/PublicHoliday-API](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/PublicHoliday-API \\"PublicHoliday-API\\") for reference _(feel free to fork, raise pull requests etc.)._ In this guide, I will try not to assume preexisting knowledge _(other than general Azure and PowerShell knowledge)_.\\n\\n### Deployment\\n\\nThe deployment steps will be separated into different sections to help simplify implementation.\\n\\n> First, make sure you adjust the names of your resources and locations to suit your naming conventions and regional locations _(such as Australia East or West Europe)_. Your deployments may fail if a name is already in use. See \\"[Microsoft Azure Naming Conventions](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/microsoft-azure-naming-conventions/ \\"Microsoft Azure Naming Conventions \\")\\" for more about Naming conventions.\\n\\n#### Create Resource Group\\n\\nThe Resource Group will contain all resources related to the API that we will deploy today.\\n\\n_However, I recommend you consider what resources might be shared outside of this API - such as API Management, and put them in a separate Shared or Common Resource Group, to keep the li.e.ecycle of your resources together (ie API resources all in one place, so if it gets decommissioned, it is as easy a deleting the Resource Group)._\\n\\n1. Log in to the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n2. Click **Click on the burger and click** [**Resource groups**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroups \\"Resource Groups\\")\\n3. Click **+ Create**\\n4. Select your **Subscription**\\n5. Type in a name for your **Resource Group** _(like \'rg-publicholidays-prd-ae\')_\\n6. Select your **Region** and click **Next: Tags**\\n7. Enter in applicable **tags** _(i.e. Application: Public Holidays API)_\\n8. Click **Next: Review + create**\\n9. Click **Create**\\n\\n![Create a resource group](/uploads/azureportal_creatergapi.png \\"Create a resource group\\")\\n\\nIf you prefer PowerShell, you can deploy a new Resource Group with the below:\\n\\n    New-AzResourceGroup -Name \'rg-publicholidays-prd-ae\' -Location \'Australia East\' -Tag @{Application=\\"Public Holidays API\\"}\\n\\n#### Create Storage Account\\n\\nNow that the Resource Group has been created, it\'s time to import our Storage Account - which will hold our Table of data around Public Holidays.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Click **Click on the burger and click** [**Storage Accounts**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts \\"Storage accounts\\")\\n 3. Click **+ Create**\\n 4. Select the **Subscription** and **Resource Group** you created earlier\\n 5. Enter in a **Name** for your **Storage Account** (_like \'funcnzpublicholidaystgac\')_\\n 6. Select your **Region** _(i.e. Australia East)_\\n 7. For **Performance**, I am going to select: **Standard**\\n 8. For **Redundancy**, as this is a demo, I will select **Locally-redundant storage (LRS). However, if** you plan on running this in production, you may consider ZRS for zone redundancy.\\n 9. If you plan on locking down the Storage Account to your Virtual Network or specific IP addresses, continue to the Networking Tab; we can accept the defaults and click: **Review**.\\n10. Click **Create**\\n\\nIf you prefer PowerShell, you can deploy a new Storage account with the below:\\n\\n    New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName \'rg-publicholidays-prd-ae\' -Name \'funcnzpublicholidaystgac\' -Location \'Australia East\' -SkuName \'Standard_LRS\' -Kind StorageV2\\n\\n#### Import Public Holiday data\\n\\n##### Create Azure Storage Account Table\\n\\nNow that we have the Storage account that will hold our Public Holiday time to import the data.\\n\\nMost of this task will be done with PowerShell, but first, we need to create the Table that will hold our Public Holidays.\\n\\n1. Log in to the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n2. Click **Click on the burger and click** [**Storage Accounts**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts \\"Storage accounts\\")\\n3. **Navigate** to your created **Storage** account\\n4. In the Navigation blade, click **Tables**\\n5. Click **+ Table**\\n6. For a Table Name, I will go with **PublicHolidays**\\n7. Click **Ok**\\n\\n![Create Azure Storage Account Table](/uploads/azureportal_createpublicholidaystable.png \\"Create Azure Storage Account Table\\")\\n\\nYou can use PowerShell to create the Table below:\\n\\n    $storageAccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName \'rg-publicholidays-prd-ae\' -Name \'funcnzpublicholidaystgac\'\\n    $storageContext = $storageAccount.Context\\n    New-AzStorageTable -Name \'PublicHolidays\' -Context $storageContext\\n\\n##### Import Public Holiday Data into Table\\n\\nNow that we have the Azure storage account and PublicHolidays table, it\'s time to import the data.\\n\\nIf you want to do this manually, the Azure Table will have the following columns:\\n\\n| Date | Country | Type | Name | Day | Year | Comments |\\n\\nWe could enter the data manually, but I will leverage the Nager API to download and parse a CSV file for a few countries. You can find the source data and code directly in the GitHub repository here: [lukemurraynz/PublicHoliday-API](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/PublicHoliday-API \\"PublicHoliday-API\\") for reference.\\n\\nTo do this, we will need PowerShell, so assuming you have logged into PowerShell and set the context to your Azure subscription, let us continue.\\n\\nI have created a CSV _(Comma-separated values)_ file with a list of countries _(i.e. US, NZ, AU)_ called \'SourceTimeDate.CSV\', but you can adjust this to suit your requirements and place it in a folder on my C:\\\\\\\\ drive called: Temp\\\\\\\\API.\\n\\nOpen **PowerShell** and **run** the following:\\n\\n    $Folder = \'C:\\\\Temp\\\\API\\\\\'\\n    $Csv = Import-csv \\"$Folder\\\\DateTimeSource\\\\SourceTimeDate.csv\\"\\n    $CurrentYear = (Get-Date).Year\\n    \\n       ForEach ($Country in $Csv)\\n      {\\n    $CountryCode = $Country.Country\\n    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \\"https://date.nager.at/PublicHoliday/Country/$CountryCode/$CurrentYear/CSV\\" -OutFile \\"$FolderAPI\\\\DateTimeSource\\\\Country$CountryCode$CurrentYear.csv\\" \\n    }\\n\\nThese cmdlets will download a bunch of CSV files into the API folder, with the Public Holidays for each Country for this year, and then you can adjust the $CurrentYear variable for future years _(i.e. 2025)_.\\n\\nOnce you have all the CSV files for your Public Holidays and before we import the data into the Azure storage table, now is the time to create a new Custom Holidays CSV; you can easily use an existing one to create a new CSV containing your company\'s public holidays or other days that may be missing from the standard list, make sure it matches the correct format and save it into the same folder.\\n\\n![Custom Public Holidays API](/uploads/customholidays_api.png \\"Custom Public Holidays API\\")\\n\\nNow that you have all your CSV files containing the Public Holidays in your Country or countries, it\'s time to import them into the Azure Table. First, we import the data using a PowerShell session logged into Azure.\\n\\n    # Imports Public Holiday into Azure Storage table\\n    # Requires AzTable Module (not part of the normal Az cmdlets)\\n    Import-Module AzTable\\n    \\n    #Imports data from CSV files into $GLobalHolidays variable\\n    $Folder = \'C:\\\\Temp\\\\API\\\\\'\\n    \\n    $GlobalHolidays = Get-ChildItem \\"$Folder\\\\DateTimeSource\\\\*.csv\\" | Foreach-Object {\\n      $basename = $_.BaseName\\n      import-csv $_ \\n    }\\n    \\n    #Connect-AzAccount\\n    #Connects to Azure Storage Account\\n    $storageAccountName = \'funcnzpublicholidaystgac\'\\n    $resourceGroupName = \'rg-publicHolidays-prd-ae\'\\n    $tableName = \'PublicHolidays\'\\n    $storageAccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $storageAccountName\\n    $storageContext = $storageAccount.Context\\n    $cloudTable = (Get-AzStorageTable -Name $tableName -Context $storageContext).CloudTable\\n    \\n      \\n    #Imports CSV data into Azure Table\\n    $counter = 0\\n    ForEach ($Holiday in $GlobalHolidays)\\n    \\n    {\\n      $Date = [DateTime]($Holiday.Date)\\n      $Dayofweek = $Date.DayOfWeek | Out-String\\n      $Year = $Date.Year\\n      $HolidayDate = Get-Date $Date -format \\"dd-MM-yyyy\\"\\n    \\n     Add-AzTableRow `\\n      -table $cloudTable `\\n      -partitionKey \'1\' `\\n      -rowKey ((++$counter)) -property @{\\"Date\\"=$HolidayDate;\\"Country\\"=$Holiday.CountryCode;\\"Type\\"=$Holiday.Type;\\"Name\\"=$Holiday.LocalName;\\"Day\\"=$Dayofweek;\\"Year\\"=$Year;\\"Comments\\"=$Holiday.Counties}\\n    \\n    }\\n    \\n    \\n    #Validate the data in the Storage table\\n    Get-AzTableRow -table $cloudTable\\n\\n![Import CSV to Azure Storage Account](/uploads/import-csvtoazuretables.gif \\"Import CSV to Azure Storage Account\\")\\n\\n![Validate Azure Storage Account Table](/uploads/import-csvtoazuretablesvalidate.gif \\"Validate Azure Storage Account Table\\")\\n\\nNow the Public Holidays are imported into the Azure storage account table with additional information, such as the Day it falls, and the Date format has been changed to suit the NZ format _(DD-MM-YYYY)_.\\n\\nIf we log in to the Azure Portal, navigate to the Storage account and under Storage Browser, we can now see our Table is full of Public Holidays.\\n\\n![](/uploads/azureportal_storagebrowser_api_table.png)\\n\\n#### Create API\\n\\nThat we have our Table with Public Holiday data, it\'s time to create our Azure Function to act as the API that will talk to the azure storage account!\\n\\n##### Create Azure Function\\n\\n 1. Log in to the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Click **Click on the burger and click** [**Resource groups**](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroups \\"Resource groups\\")\\n 3. Navigate to your **resource group** and click **+ Create**\\n 4. Search for: **Function**\\n 5. Select **Function App**, and click **Create**\\n 6. Enter your **Function App Name** _(i.e. \'func-nzpublicHolidays-prd-ae\')_\\n 7. For Runtime Stack, select **PowerShell Core**\\n 8. Select the latest version (at this time, it\'s **7.2**)\\n 9. Select your **Region**\\n10. Select **Windows**\\n11. Set your **Plan** _(in my example, its Consumption (Serverless))_\\n12. Click **Review + Create**\\n13. Click **Create**\\n\\n![Azure Function - Create](/uploads/azureportal_createazfunctionapiwin.png \\"Azure Function - Create\\")\\n\\n##### Configure Environment Variables\\n\\nNow that the Function App has been created before creating the GetPublicHoliday function, we need to add a few environment variables that the Function will use; these variables will contain the ResourceGroup and Storage account name.\\n\\n1. **Navigate** to your **Azure Function**\\n2. Click **Configuration**\\n3. Click **+ New application setting**\\n4. Under the name, add: **PublicHolidayRESOURCEGROUPNAME**\\n5. For value, type in the name of your resource group.\\n6. Add a second application setting named: **PublicHolidaySTORAGEACCNAME**\\n7. For value, type in the name of your storage account that contains the Public Holiday table.\\n8. Click **Save** _(to save the variables)_.\\n\\n![Azure Function - Variables](/uploads/azureportal_funcapp_api_variables.png \\"Azure Function - Variables\\")\\n\\n##### Configure Managed Identity\\n\\nNext, we need to give the Function App the ability to read the Azure storage account. To do this, we need to configure a System assigned managed identity.\\n\\n 1. **Navigate** to your **Azure Function**\\n 2. Click **Identity**\\n 3. Under the System assigned heading, toggle the status to **On**\\n 4. Click **Save**\\n 5. Select **Yes**, to enable the System assigned managed identity\\n 6. Under Permissions, click **Azure role assignments**\\n 7. Click **+ Add role assignment**\\n 8. For Scope, select **Storage**\\n 9. Select your Subscription and storage account containing your Public Holiday data\\n10. For role, select **Contributor** _(Storage Table Data Reader is not enough)._\\n11. Click **Save**\\n\\n##### Configure Requirements\\n\\nThe Azure function app will rely on a few PowerShell Modules; for the FunctionApp to load them, we need to add them to the requirements.psd1 file.\\n\\n1. **Navigate** to your **Azure Function**\\n2. Click **App files**\\n3. Change the dropdown to **requirements.psd1**\\n4. In the hash array, comment out the #Az module line _(as this will load the entire Az Module set, which will cause an increased delay in the startup as those extra modules aren\'t needed)_, and add the following:\\n\\n       # This file enables modules to be automatically managed by the Functions service.\\n       # See https://aka.ms/functionsmanageddependency for additional information.\\n       #\\n       @{\\n           # For latest supported version, go to \'https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az\'. \\n           # To use the Az module in your function app, please uncomment the line below.\\n           #\'Az\' = \'8.*\'\\n           \'Az.Accounts\'  = \'2.*\'\\n           \'Az.Storage\'   = \'4.*\'\\n           \'Az.Resources\' = \'2.*\'\\n           \'AzTable\'      = \'2.*\'\\n       \\n       }\\n5. Click **Save**\\n\\n##### Create Function PublicHolidays\\n\\nNow that the Function App has been configured, it is time to create our Function.\\n\\n1. **Navigate** to your **Azure Function**\\n2. Click **Functions**\\n3. Click **+ Create**\\n4. Change Development environment to **Develop in Portal**\\n5. Select Template, an **HTTP trigger**\\n6. For the New Function name, I will go with **GetPublicHoliday**\\n7. Change Authorization level to **Anonymous** _(if you aren\'t going to implement API Management, select Function and look at whitelisting your IP only, we will be locking it down to API Management later)_.\\n8. Click **Create**\\n\\n![Create Azure Function App](/uploads/azureportal_createfunctionpublicholidays.png \\"Create Azure Function App\\")\\n\\n1. Click **Code + Test**\\n2. Copy the following Code into the run.ps1 file, this code is core to the Function that will read the HTTP request and bring back a PowerShell object with the Public Holiday information as part of a GET request:\\n\\n       <# The code above does the following, explained in English:\\n       1.

Click **Save**\\n\\n##### Test Function - PublicHolidays\\n\\nBefore proceeding with the next step, it\'s time to test the function.\\n\\n1. **Navigate** to your **Azure Function**\\n2. Click **Functions**\\n3. Click **GetPublicHoliday**\\n4. Click **Code + Test**\\n5. Click **Test/Run**\\n6. Change HTTP method to **Get**\\n7. Under Query, add Country value and Date value.\\n\\nNote: Make sure the date and country formats match what is in the Azure storage account.\\n\\nYou can also Invoke the function app directly with PowerShell, with the Date and Country as Parameters at the end:\\n\\n    Invoke-RestMethod -URI \\"https://func-nzpublicholidays-prd-ae.azurewebsites.net/api/GetPublicHoliday?Date=25-12-2023&CountryCode=NZ\\"\\n\\n![Test Public Holiday API](/uploads/testpublicholidayapi.gif \\"Test Public Holiday API\\")\\n\\nCongratulations! You have now created a Public Holiday API that you can call for automation! You can lock down the Function App to only certain IPs or proceed to configure Azure API Management.\\n\\n##### Configure Azure API Management\\n\\nNow that the Function App responds to requests, we can expose the HTTP endpoint through [Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-openapi-definition?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Expose serverless APIs from HTTP endpoints using Azure API Management\\"). Azure API Management will give greater flexibility and security over API endpoints, particularly when dealing with more than one API. Azure API Management also offers inbuilt shared cache functionality and integration into [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\" Azure Cache for Redis\xae2\\").\\n\\n1. Log in to the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n2. **Navigate** to your **Azure Function**\\n3. On the Navigation blade, select **API Management**\\n4. Click **Create New**\\n5. Select your subscription, **Region**, and organisation **name**.\\n6. Select a [**Pricing Tier**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/api-management/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\" API Management pricing\\")\\n7. Click **Review + Create**\\n8. Click **Create**\\n\\n![Create Azure API Management](/uploads/azureportal_createapimanagement.png)\\n\\n1. Wait for 10 minutes to half an hour for provisioning to take place, and Azure API Management will be in an activating state.\\n2. Once API Management has been provisioned, you can **copy** the **Virtual IP (VIP)** addresses of API Management and **restrict** your **function** app to **only** allow **inbound** access from that **IP**.\\n3. Once you have done that, add the GetPublicHoliday function app into Azure API Management, add the paths to add a version, and then, using the subscription key, you run the following command to pull data.\\n\\n    Invoke-RestMethod -uri \\"https://apims-nzpublicholidays-prd-ae.azure-api.net/v1/GetPublicHoliday?Date=4/05/2022&CountryCode=NZ&Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key=$KEY\\""},{"id":"azure/microsoft-azure-zonalallocationfailed","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/microsoft-azure-zonalallocationfailed","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-27-microsoft-azure-zonalallocationfailed.md","title":"Microsoft Azure - ZonalAllocationFailed","description":"Error code: AllocationFailed or ZonalAllocationFailed","date":"2022-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":4.465,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Microsoft Azure - ZonalAllocationFailed","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"date":"2022-07-27 00:00:00 +1300","toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"/uploads/zonalallocationfailed.png"},"slug":"azure/microsoft-azure-zonalallocationfailed"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Create a Public Holidays API using Microsoft Azure","permalink":"/2022/08/09/create-a-public-holidays-api-using-microsoft-azure"},"nextItem":{"title":"Azure Virtual Machine and a custom MAC address","permalink":"/azure/azure-virtual-machine-and-mac-address-software-licensing"}},"content":"> **Error code**: AllocationFailed or ZonalAllocationFailed\\n>\\n> **Error message**: \\"Allocation failed. We do not have sufficient capacity for the requested VM size in this region. Read more about improving likelihood of allocation success at [https://aka.ms/allocation-guidance](https://aka.ms/allocation-guidance?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"https://aka.ms/allocation-guidance\\")\\"\\n\\nWhen you create a virtual machine _(VM)_, start stopped _(deallocated)_ VMs, or resize a VM, Microsoft Azure allocates compute resources to your subscription.\\n\\n![ZonalAllocationFailed](/uploads/zonalallocationfailed.png \\"ZonalAllocationFailed\\")\\n\\nMicrosoft is continually investing in additional infrastructure and features to ensure that they always have all VM types available to support customer demand. However, you may occasionally experience resource allocation failures because of unprecedented growth in demand for Azure services in specific regions.\\n\\nThese tips, also apply to the \'Following SKUs have failed for Capacity Restrictions\' error.\\n\\nThis error could also be caused by a parameter issue with your Infrastructure as Code deployments, if you are to restrictive and it attempts to create a resource that isn\'t supported - an example is a SKU that doesn\'t support Accelerated Networking, or an attempt to deploy an Ultra SSD disk for a SKU that doesn\'t deploy it.\\n\\n#### **Waiting for more Compute to be added to the Azure server clusters may not be an option, so what can you do?**\\n\\n##### Raise a Support Case\\n\\n* Take a screenshot of the error\\n* Copy the Activity/Deployment ID\\n* Take note of the Region\\n* Take note of the Availability Zone.\\n\\nLet [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\" Azure Support\\") know; that Microsoft may already be aware, but raising a support request helps identify potentially impacted customers. If you know of other SKUs you need to deploy, you can let them know.\\n\\n##### Purchase On-demand Capacity Reservation\\n\\n[On-demand Capacity Reservation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/capacity-reservation-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"On-demand Capacity Reservation\\") enables you to reserve Compute capacity in an Azure region or an Availability Zone for any duration of time. \\n\\nUnlike [Reserved Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/reserved-vm-instances/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Reserved Instances\\"), you do not have to sign up for a 1-year or a 3-year term commitment.\\n\\nOnce the Capacity Reservation is created, the capacity is available immediately and is exclusively reserved for your use until the reservation is deleted.\\n\\nCapacity Reservations are priced at the same rate as the underlying VM size. \\n\\nFor example, if you create a reservation for the D2s_v3 VMs, you will start getting billed for the D2s_v3 VMs, even if the reservation is not being used.\\n\\nSo why would you purchase On-demand Capacity reservations?\\n\\n* You are operating Azure workloads that scale out and run off a fresh image, like a Citrix farm and want to ensure the capacity is available for the minimum workloads you need.\\n* You have a project coming up where you need the capacity to be available.\\n\\n##### Redeploy to another Availability Zone\\n\\nThe server cluster that ARM (Azure Resource Manager) attempted to deploy your workload may not have the necessary capacity, but another Availability Zone _(datacenter)_ might.\\n\\nMake sure your Virtual Machine is not in a Proximtry or Avalibility Group and do the following.\\n\\n1. **Take note of the Availability Zone that your deployment failed** _(i.e. Availability Zone 1)_\\n2. **Remove any resources** that may have been created as part of the original failed deployment.\\n3. **Redeploy** your workload and **select** another Availability **Zone**, such as _(2 - if your failed deployment was in Zone 1)_\\n\\n##### Change the Virtual Machine version  \\n\\nBy version, I don\'t mean [Generation 1 and Generation 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/generation-2?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#features-and-capabilities \\"Generation 1 vs. generation 2 features\\") Virtual Machines; I mean the version of underlying Compute; when you look at a VM SKU size, you will see:\\n\\n> Standard_DC24s_**v3**\\n>\\n> \\\\[Family\\\\] + _\\\\[Sub-family\\\\]_* + \\\\[# of vCPUs\\\\] + _\\\\[Constrained vCPUs\\\\]_* + \\\\[Additive Features\\\\] + _\\\\[Accelerator Type\\\\]_* + **\\\\[Version\\\\]**\\n\\nYou can read more about Virtual Machine Naming conversions \\"[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/vm-naming-conventions?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure virtual machine sizes naming conventions\\")\\".\\n\\nThe version of the VM series links to the underlying hardware associated with the Virtual Machine series; with most new hardware releases, the version changes; an example is: from v3 to v4.  \\n\\n> #Tip: Microsoft may run a promotion on the pricing for early adopters from time to time, to move to the new version; they can be seen from the Azure Portal with \\"Promo\\" in the name.\\n\\n1. You can **change the version of the SKU** by looking in the Azure Portal, **Sizing**, and you should be **select** different **versions** of the same SKU; _if you are at v5, try resizing to v4 - or the other way around_.  \\n\\nRemember that changing the VM SKU will force the Virtual Machine to deallocate _(stop)_, as it triggers ARM to stand up the Virtual Machine on different server clusters/hardware.\\n\\n_I have found that there are no noticeable decreases in performance for most workloads, but keep in mind you may be returning on older hardware - but it should get you going, and then you can update the SKU to the latest version later._\\n\\n\\n##### Increase regional vCPU quotas\\n\\nAzure Resource Manager enforces two types of vCPU quotas for virtual machines:\\n\\n* standard vCPU quotas\\n* spot vCPU quotas\\nStandard vCPU quotas apply to pay-as-you-go VMs and reserved VM instances. They are enforced at two tiers, for each subscription, in each region:\\n\\n* The first tier is the total regional vCPU quota.\\n* The second tier is the VM-family vCPU quota such as D-series vCPUs.\\n\\nCheck your subscription quotas and if necessary, raise a request to increase them by following the guide here: [Increase regional vCPU quotas]{https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quotas/regional-quota-requests?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796}"},{"id":"azure/azure-virtual-machine-and-mac-address-software-licensing","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/azure-virtual-machine-and-mac-address-software-licensing","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-19-azure-virtual-machine-and-mac-address-software-licensing.md","title":"Azure Virtual Machine and a custom MAC address","description":"You may need an Azure Virtual Machine to install or license software bound to a media access control address (MAC address).","date":"2022-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":2.005,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"date":"2022-07-19 00:00:00 +1200","title":"Azure Virtual Machine and a custom MAC address","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":false,"header":{"teaser":"images/iazure-marketplace-banner.png"},"slug":"azure/azure-virtual-machine-and-mac-address-software-licensing"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Microsoft Azure - ZonalAllocationFailed","permalink":"/azure/microsoft-azure-zonalallocationfailed"},"nextItem":{"title":"Deploy Azure Naming Tool into an Azure WebApp as a container","permalink":"/2022/07/11/deploy-azure-naming-tool-into-an-azure-webapp-as-a-container"}},"content":"You may need an Azure Virtual Machine to install or license software bound to a media access control address _(MAC address)_.\\n\\nIn Microsoft Azure, you can make changes to the Primary Network interface; these changes include manually setting the IP settings to changing the MAC address - these settings are managed by the underlying Network Interface and Azure host.\\n\\n> _If you do inadvertently make changes to this, you will lose connection to the Azure Virtual Machine, however, don\'t panic!

These conventions also help associate cloud usage costs with business teams via chargeback and show-back accounting mechanisms, along with rapidly identifying what services are used across services.\\n\\nA useful naming convention composes resource names from important information about each resource. A well-chosen name helps you quickly identify the resource\'s type, associated workload, deployment environment, and the Azure region hosting it. Some resource names, such as PaaS services with public endpoints or virtual machine DNS labels, have global scopes, so they must be unique across the Azure platform.\\n\\nThere\'s no one size fits Azure naming convention; it needs to suit your organisation. However, it is worth noting that there are limitations to naming rules for Azure resources.\\n\\n* [Naming rules and restrictions for Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Naming rules and restrictions for Azure resources\\")\\n* [Define your naming convention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Define your naming convention\\")\\n\\nWith rules around naming resources that are Global, specific to Resource Groups or that have maximum character limits that can\'t contain specific characters - it can become a project on its own, the world of Cloud where resources are treated as [cattle and not pets](http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/ \\"The History of Pets vs Cattle and How to Use the Analogy Properly\\") - the effort to develop a proper naming convention, used across teams or even companies can be quite complex.\\n\\nThis is where the Azure Naming Tool, as part of the Microsoft Cloud Adoption framework, comes into play.\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\nThe Naming Tool _(v2 as of June 2022)_ was developed using a naming pattern based on [Microsoft\'s best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging). Once the organisational components have been defined by an administrator, users can use the tool to generate a name for the desired Azure resource.\\n\\n![Azure \\\\[naming-tool\\\\]](/uploads/azurenamingtoollogo.png \\"Azure [naming-tool]\\")\\n\\nThis tool sitting in the [Azure Naming Tool](https://github.com/mspnp/AzureNamingTool) GitHub repository runs as a standalone Web _(.NET 6 Blazor application)_ application using stateless JSON files for its Configuration and offers users the ability to generate and customise their own [Microsoft Azure Naming convention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Define your naming convention\\") taking all the restrictions into account. In addition, Azure Naming Tool - also provides a Swagger API that can be used in your Infrastructure as Code deployments to generate the names of resources on the fly.\\n\\n![Azure Naming Tool - Reference](/uploads/azurenamingtool_referencepage.png \\"Azure Naming Tool - Reference\\")\\n\\nThis information is straight from the project README.md:\\n\\n> **Project Components**\\n>\\n> * UI/Admin\\n> * API\\n> * JSON configuration files\\n> * Dockerfile\\n>\\n> **Important Notes**\\n>\\n> The following are important notes/aspects of the Azure Naming Tool:\\n>\\n> * The application is designed to run as a stand-alone solution, with no internet/Azure connection.\\n> * The application can be run as a .NET 6 site, or as a Docker container.\\n> * The site can be hosted in any environment, including internal or in a public/private cloud.\\n> * The application uses local JSON files to store the configuration of the components.\\n> * The application requires persistent storage. If running as a container, a volume is required to store configuration files.\\n> * The application contains a _repository_ folder, which contains the default component configuration JSON files. When deployed, these files are copied to the _settings_ folder.\\n> * The Admin interface allows configurations to be \\"reset\\", if needed. This process copies the configuration from the _repository_ folder to the _settings_ folder.\\n> * The API requires an API Key for all executions. A default API Key (guid) will be generated on first launch. This value can be updated in the Admin section.\\n> * On first launch, the application will prompt for the Admin password to be set.\\n\\n### Deployment\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\nToday, we will deploy the Azure Naming Tool into an Azure WebApp, running as a Container.![Azure Naming Tool - High-Level Architecture](/uploads/azurenamingtool_architecture.png \\"Azure Naming Tool - High-Level Architecture\\")\\n\\nThe Azure resources we will create are:\\n\\n* [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\" Azure Container Registry\\")\\n* [Azure Storage Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/category/storage/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Storage\\") _(with File Share - to store our persistent data and Configuration)_\\n* [Azure App Service Plan and App Service for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/containers/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\" Web App for Containers\\") _(to run our Azure Naming Tool)_\\n\\nYou need Contributor rights in at least a Resource Group to deploy these Azure resources.\\n\\nWe will be using a mix of services such as:\\n\\n* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/ \\"Docker\\")\\n* [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"PowerShell\\") & [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) documentation\\")\\n* [Azure Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Bicep documentation\\")\\n\\nTo reduce the need to set up these dependencies on individual workstations, we will use a mix of the Azure Cloud Shell and Azure Portal. If you haven\'t set up your Azure Cloud Shell, you can refer to an article I wrote previously \\"[here](https://luke.geek.nz/2022/03/07/setup-azure-cloud-shell/ \\"Setup Azure Cloud Shell \\")\\" for this remainder of this article I am going to assume you have it set up already.\\n\\nNote: I will connect to the Cloud Shell using the [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/it-ops-talk/azure-cloud-shell-in-the-windows-terminal?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure Cloud Shell in the Windows Terminal\\") so that any screenshots will be of the Terminal, but it\'s the same behaviour if I used the browser experience.\\n\\n#### Clone the Git Repository\\n\\nNow is time to clone the git repository into our Cloud Shell so that we can build the docker image definition.\\n\\n1. **Log in** to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure - Portal\\") and open up the **Azure Cloud Shell** _(make sure you are in PowerShell (not Bash))._\\n2. **Run** the following **commands** and wait for the Repository to be cloned directly into the CloudShell virtual instance:\\n\\n       git clone https://github.com/mspnp/AzureNamingTool\\n\\n![Azure Naming Tool - Clone Repo](/uploads/AzNamingTool_RepoClone.gif \\"Azure Naming Tool - Clone Repo\\")\\n\\n#### Create Resource Group & Azure Container Registry\\n\\nNow that we have our Repository, it\'s time to create our Resource Group and Container Registry _(Public)_; we will use a few PowerShell cmdlets to develop the resources; make sure you change the name of your Container Registry and Resource Group to match your environment.\\n\\n1. Log in to the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure - Portal\\") and open up the **Azure Cloud Shell** _(make sure you are in PowerShell (not Bash))._\\n2. **Run** the following **commands** to **create** the **Resource Group** and the **Azure Container Registry**:\\n\\n**Remember to change the name of the Container Registry - this is a globally unique resource, so if someone else has already created a registry with the same name, yours won\'t deploy.**\\n\\n       $ResourceGroup = New-AzResourceGroup -Name \'AzNamingTool-PROD-RG\' -Location \'Australia East\'\\n       $registry = New-AzContainerRegistry -ResourceGroupName \'AzNamingTool-PROD-RG\' -Name \\"ContainerRegistryAzNamingTool\\" -EnableAdminUser -Sku Basic\\n       Connect-AzContainerRegistry -Name $registry.Name\\n\\n![AzureNaming Tool - Create Resource Group & Azure Container Registry](/uploads/AzNamingTool_ContainerRegistryImageBuild.gif \\"AzureNaming Tool - Create Resource Group & Azure Container Registry\\")\\n\\n#### Build your image to the Azure Container Registry\\n\\nThe Azure Container Registry will be stored to host and build your image definition, as Docker support is not native to the Azure Cloud Shell; now that we have created it is time to build the image and push it to the registry. Ensure you are in the AzNamingTool folder _(CloudAdoptionFramework/ready/AzNamingTool/)_.\\n\\n1. **Run** the following **Azure CLI** command:\\n\\n       az acr build --image azurenamingtool:v1 --registry $registry.Name --file Dockerfile .\\n\\n![AzureNaming Tool - Azure Container Registry](/uploads/AzNamingTool_ContainerRegistryImageBuild.gif \\"AzureNaming Tool - Azure Container Registry\\")\\n\\n#### Deploy Azure App Service and WebApp\\n\\nFor the following, we will use a mix of Azure Bicep and the Azure Portal _(I ran into an Access Key error and PowerShell_ [_issue_](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/issues/10645 \\"webapp: New-AzWebApp does not set LinuxFxVersion from ContainerImageName\\") _when attempting to map the share using Bicep and PowerShell - if you managed to complete the setup feel free to add a comment in the comments below)_.\\n\\nAzure Bicep will be used to create the App Service and Storage account + file share, and then we will use the Azure Portal to complete the setup _(Azure WebApp as a Container and mapping the persistent file share)_.\\n\\nFirst, we need to install Azure Bicep and import the Bicep file into Cloud Shell; we could Upload the file straight from the Portal or clone a [repo](https://github.com/lukemurraynz/Azure-Bicep \\"Azure-Bicep\\") with the file - but because I am using Azure Cloud Shell from the Terminal because Azure Cloud Shell runs on Linux - I am going to use \'nano\' to create the Bicep file manually - feel free to do any of the above options to get the Azure Bicep into Cloud Shell.\\n\\n##### Install Azure Bicep\\n\\n1. To **install** Azure **Bicep,** run:\\n\\n       az bicep install\\n\\n![Azure Naming Tool - Install Azure Bicep](/uploads/install_azbicep.gif \\"Azure Naming Tool - Install Azure Bicep\\")\\n\\n##### Create Azure Bicep File\\n\\nWe will use Nano, copy the Azure Bicep file and Paste it into Nano, and make sure you adjust the parameters to suit your environment before deploying.\\n\\n1. In the **Azure Cloud Shell**, let us create the file by typing.\\n\\n       nano AzNamingTool_main.bicep\\n\\n2. **Paste** the Azure **Bicep file** and do any final edits\\n3. Now we need to save the file; press **Ctrl+X** on your keyboard\\n4. Press **Y** to save the file\\n5. Verify the file name and press **Enter** to accept the filename.\\n\\n   ![Azure Naming Tool - Create Bicep file](/uploads/createazbicepfile.gif \\"Azure Naming Tool - Create Bicep file\\")\\n\\n**Remember to edit the Azure Bicep parameters, the Resource Names need to be globally unique, so you may run into problems if someone has deployed using the same name!**\\n\\n```bicep title=\\"AzNamingTool_main.bicep\\"\\n//Related to a Blog Article: https://luke.geek.nz for setting up Azure Naming Tool.\\n///Parameter Setting\\nparam location string = resourceGroup().location\\n\\n//Adjust Parameter values to match your naming conventions\\n\\nparam serverfarms_AzNamingTool_ASP_Prod_name string = \'AzNamingTool-ASP-Prod\'\\nparam storageAccounts_aznamingstgacc_name string = \'aznaming\'\\n\\n// The following Parameters are used add Tags to your deployed resources.

In your App Service, select **Configuration**, then **General Settings**\\n2. Check **\'On**\' under \'Always On\'\\n3. Click **Save**\\n\\n###### Configure Firewall\\n\\nYour App Service will be publically accessible by default, and although you may want to link it to your network via a Private Endpoint, locking down by Public IP may be suitable in some scenarios _(such as this demo environment)_. \\n\\n1. To lock it down to a specific Public IP, in your App Service, Select **Networking**, then **Access restriction.**\\n2.

Let\'s look at migrating workloads between them, by using [Azure Resource Mover](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/resource-mover/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"What is Azure Resource Mover?\\").\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\n![Azure Resource Mover](/uploads/azureresourcemover_header.png \\"Keep calm and migrate it in Azure\\")\\n\\nAzure Resource Mover helps you to move Azure resources between Azure regions, offering a single pane of glass to migrate different resource types, such as Virtual Machines or Azure SQL databases from a single portal without having to know how to migrate the individual underlying resources, or trying to work out the dependencies for each resource.\\n\\n#### Why would you migrate resources between Regions?\\n\\nLet\u2019s start with why would you migrate resources between regions? Common scenarios include:\\n\\n* Taking advantage of new Azure region expansions to be closer to customers and reduce latency _(such as migrating from Australia East to New Zealand North)_.\\n* Increasing availability and resilience by moving to Azure Availability Zones, from regions that don\u2019t currently support it.\\n* Meeting data residential and compliance requirements.\\n* Consolidating workloads for mergers and acquisitions.\\n* The cost of resources in one region may also be cheaper than in another.\\n\\n#### So, what are the risks of migrating resources?\\n\\nWhatever your reason, moving your applications from Point A to Point B is often no easy task. Here are common reasons why:\\n\\n* Moving resources can pose a risk of an outage.\\n* Workloads are often made up of multiple services, each requiring its own method and tools to move.\\n* Interdependencies are often not understood.\\n* Testing and rollback of these complex scenarios can be daunting.\\n\\n#### So, what are the benefits of using Azure Resource Mover?\\n\\nSo, what are some of the benefits that Azure Resource Mover offers us?\\n\\n* The ability to plan with ease, reducing the time and complexity of your move.\\n* Streamline your move process by identifying dependencies.\\n* Plan and test your move multiple times.\\n* Stage your move as part of scheduled downtime.\\n* Azure Resource Mover helps you orchestrate seamlessly with a consistent experience across common Azure resources\u200b:\\n* Move multiple resources through a single pane of glass.\\n* Reduce manual touchpoints, which could increase the change of services being missed.\\n* Reduce overall time for your move from months to weeks or days* (based on the service and data being consumed).\\n* Azure Resource Mover helps you move with confidence by planning, testing, and moving related resources together and validating and testing your move before final commitment _(by testing your migrated services, while having the peace of mind that your source resources are left intact until you commit to the migration)_.\\n\\n> So to recap, Azure Resource Mover offers you a unified experience to move multiple resource types across regions while validating dependencies between services and giving you the flexibility to adjust resources such as the Names, SKUs and Availability Zones during the migration to the destination region.\\n\\n#### What can Azure Resource Mover move?\\n\\nThe currently supported resources _(as of July 2022)_ are:\\n\\n* Azure Virtual Machines\\n* Azure SQL Database\\n* Azure Virtual Network\\n* SQL elastic pools\\n* Azure Load balancer\\n* Public IP\\n* Resource group\\n* Network security group\\n* Network interfaces\\n* Azure Availability Sets\\n\\nAnd Azure Storage account region replication support is scheduled in the next 6-9 months to be released so the storage account migration should be ready by the time the NZ North comes live.\\n\\nAn updated list of Resources currently supported by Azure Resource Mover can be found here: [What resources can I move across regions using Resource Mover?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/resource-mover/common-questions?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#what-resources-can-i-move-across-regions-using-resource-mover \\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/resource-mover/common-questions?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#what-resources-can-i-move-across-regions-using-resource-mover\\")\\n\\n#### Azure Resource Mover - The 6-Step Process!\\n\\n![Azure Resource Mover - 6 Step Process](/uploads/azure-resource-mover-6-step-process.png \\"Azure Resource Mover - 6 Step Process\\")\\n\\nAzure Resource Mover uses a 6-step process.\\n\\n1. The first step is to **select** the **resources** you\xb4d like to transfer! _A tip is to just pick the Virtual Machine object if you are migrating Virtual Machines, the dependencies will be identified by the Azure Resource Mover service itself!_\\n2. The **dependency check** will be performed, identifying that you need to move other resources along with your virtual machine _(Resource Group, NIC, Managed Disks etc.)_\\n3. Start the **preparation**. This step initiates the preparation while creating a resource group with a dedicated Storage Account and a Recovery Services Vault to perform the move. The prepare step also creates the underlying ARM template deployments for the destination region.\\n4. **Move** initiation starts the process of transferring the resources to the target region. Certain dependencies should be \'committed\' before preparation can be initiated, on other resources. If your resource is stateless such as a Network interface, a new ARM deployment will occur, but if your machine is stateful such as a Virtual Machine, Azure Site Recovery will start to copy the disk of your source machine to the target region.  \\n   **ATTENTION! Resources might be temporarily not available \u2013 perform these steps out of business hours**\\n5. **Commit** your move or discard the move! Depending on if you want to complete the move process you can decide whether you want to keep or remove the replicated resources in the destination region.\\n6. **Delete** the **source** is the cleanup step required to remove the source resources from the region you have transferred from to finish your migration.\\n\\n### Let\'s see Azure Resource Mover in action\\n\\n![Azure Resource Mover - In Action](/uploads/azure-resource-mover-arm-in-action.png \\"Azure Resource Mover - In Action\\")\\n\\nSo enough talking, let us see Azure Resource Mover in action?\\n\\n#### Demo\\n\\nFor our demo, we are going to migrate from Australia East to West US3.\\n\\n> Make sure you review your [quota and subscription limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/check-usage-against-limits?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Check resource usage against limits\\"), for the other region before you look to migrate them.\\n\\n![Azure Regions  - Australia East to West US3](/uploads/azure-resource-mover-australia-to-westus3.png \\"Azure Regions  - Australia East to West US3\\")\\n\\nSo what resources are we going to migrate?\\n\\n* Virtual Network\\n* Azure SQL Database\\n* Azure Virtual Machine & associated dependencies _(Resource Groups, Network Interfaces, Managed Disks)._\\n\\n_Note: There is no Audio in the demo video below, but it will guide you through Azure Resource Mover and some of the options._\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7szAjZu2yc\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n#### Some items to note\\n\\n* You can\'t select individual disks as resources to move across regions. However, disks are moved as part of a VM move.\\n* You can migrate encrypted Virtual Machines but needs manual intervention to copy the keys\\n* You can move resources to another subscription AFTER moving resources to the destination region.\\n* You cannot move peered Virtual Networks across subscriptions, you need to remove the peering first, then re-add it back in the destination region.\\n* Make sure your quota and required services have been registered and increased for the additional region\\n* Azure Resource Mover can be used to migrate Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts across regions.\\n* DNS records can be key to reducing the complexity and interruption to end users as part of your migration.\\n* There are PowerShell cmdlets _(i.e., New-AzResourceMoverMoveCollection)_\\n\\n### Additional Resources\\n\\nTo learn more about Azure Resource Mover, visit the Azure Resource Mover page.\\n\\n* [azure.microsoft.com/services/resource-mover](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/resource-mover/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n\\nAzure Resource Mover videos:\\n\\n* [Microsoft Azure Resource Region 2 Region Migration - Luke Murray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd1Egke6ESs)\\n* [Azure Unblogged - Azure Resource Mover](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/azure-unblogged-azure-resource-mover/ba-p/2050036?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n* [Azure Friday Video](https://twitter.com/azurefriday/status/1388863346255015943?s=20)\\n* [Azure Resource Mover - Move resources between regions, subscriptions and resource groups -John Savill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FslxGE9YJM)"},{"id":"azure/microsoft-azure-portal-global-advanced-filters","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/microsoft-azure-portal-global-advanced-filters","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-12-microsoft-azure-portal-global-advanced-filters.md","title":"Microsoft Azure Portal - Global & Advanced Filters","description":"We\'ve all been there!

Click on \'**Settings**\' on the top right-hand navigation bar\\n3. ![Azure Portal - Settings](/uploads/azureportal_settings.png)\\n4. Click on the **dropdown list** under the Default subscription filter\\n5. Here you can **select** or **de-select** the **subscriptions** you want to display by default in the Microsoft Azure Portal.\\n6. ![Azure Portal - Global Filter](/uploads/azureportal_default_subscription_filter.png)\\n7. There is no Save button, the changes will automatically take effect.\\n\\n#### Advanced Filters\\n\\nLet us take a look at the Advanced subscription filters.\\n\\n1. Log in to the Microsoft [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n2. Click on \'**Settings**\' on the top right-hand navigation bar\\n3. ![Azure Portal - Settings](/uploads/azureportal_settings.png)\\n4. Toggle **Advanced Filters**\\n5. Click **Continue** to reload the Azure Portal, your Global subscription filter will be changed to an advanced filter.\\n6. Click **Modify Advanced filters**\\n7. Click **+ Create a filter**\\n8. Here you have the ability to create a filter or filters, to help match your requirements. You can create filters based on subscription ID and subscription name.\\n\\n| Filter Type | Operator | Value | Note |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Subscription ID | == | Subscription ID array | Equal |\\n| Subscription name | != | Subscription ID array | Does not Equal |\\n| Subscription state | contains | String | Contains |\\n|  | !contains | String | Does not Contain |\\n|  | startswith | String | Starts with |\\n|  | !startswith | String | Does not start with |\\n|  | endswith | String | Ends with |\\n|  | !endswith | String | Does not end with |\\n\\n| Subscription State | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Activate/Enabled | Your Azure subscription is active. You can use the subscription to deploy new resources and manage existing ones. |\\n| Deleted | Your Azure subscription has been deleted along with all underlying resources/data. |\\n| Disabled | Your Azure subscription is disabled and can no longer be used to create or manage Azure resources. While in this state, your virtual machines are de-allocated, temporary IP addresses are freed, storage is read-only and other services are disabled. |\\n| Expired | Your Azure subscription is expired because it was canceled. You can reactivate an expired subscription. |\\n| Past Due | Your Azure subscription has an outstanding payment pending. Your subscription is still active but failure to pay the dues may result in subscription being disabled. |\\n| Warned | Your Azure subscription is in a warned state and will be disabled shortly if the warning reason isn\'t addressed. A subscription may be in warned state if its past due, canceled by user, or if the subscription has expired. |\\n\\n1. Using the logic above, we can easily create filters based on the state of a subscription and name, an example is, creating a filter that displays all subscriptions with \'dev\' in its name:\\n2. ![Azure Portal - Advanced Subscription Filter](/uploads/azureportal_advanced_subscription_filter.png)\\n\\nYou can only have one Filter displayed at once in the Azure Portal, but you can easily switch between them, by clicking **Activate**, next to the filter name.\\n\\nIf you wish to disable Advanced Filters, and go back to the Global Filter, you can deselect the Toggle for Advanced Filters.\\n\\n### Additional Resources\\n\\n#### Microsoft Docs\\n\\nTo get the most out of your Azure Portal experience, the below Microsoft documentation is worth a read _(in no particular order)_.\\n\\n* [Manage Azure portal settings and preferences](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/set-preferences?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Manage Azure portal settings and preferences\\")\\n* [Azure subscription states](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/subscription-states?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure subscription states\\")\\n* [Add, remove, and rearrange favorites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-add-remove-sort-favorites?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Add, remove, and rearrange favorites\\")\\n* [View and filter Azure resource information](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/manage-filter-resource-views?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"View and filter Azure resource information\\")\\n\\n#### Send Feedback to Microsoft\\n\\nOn the last note, Microsoft has made it easy to create Feedback, that will get fed back to the Azure Portal and product teams straight in the Microsoft Azure Portal, if you ever see anything that may need changing, or a link out of date don\'t hesitate to send your feedback to Microsoft, by pressing the little Feedback button on the top right of your navigation bar. \\n\\n![Azure Portal - Feedback](/uploads/azureportal_feedback.png)\\n\\nThe Microsoft Azure portal is in development all the time and is now built with [Azure Resource Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"What is Azure Resource Graph?\\") capabilities, it is very easy not to try and see new functionality, so I recommend you keep your eyes out and try new features."},{"id":"/2022/06/12/microsoft-azure-portal-recent-resources","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022/06/12/microsoft-azure-portal-recent-resources","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-12-microsoft-azure-portal-recent-resources.md","title":"Microsoft Azure Portal - Recent Resources","description":"The Microsoft Azure Portal displays a list of Recent resources (whether they are subscriptions or Resources) you have accessed, usually when you first log in to the portal itself.","date":"2022-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":0.815,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Microsoft Azure Portal - Recent Resources","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"date":"2022-06-12 00:00:00 +1300","toc":false,"header":{"teaser":"images/iazure-marketplace-banner.png"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Microsoft Azure Portal - Global & Advanced Filters","permalink":"/azure/microsoft-azure-portal-global-advanced-filters"},"nextItem":{"title":"You don\u2019t have authorization to perform action \'Microsoft.Resources/deployments/validate/action\'","permalink":"/azure/you-don-t-have-authorization-to-perform-action-microsoft.resources-deployments-validate-action"}},"content":"The Microsoft Azure Portal displays a list of Recent resources _(whether they are subscriptions or Resources)_ you have accessed, usually when you first log in to the portal itself.\\n\\nThis capability makes it quick to access resources you use the most often, but sometimes you may want to view the resources in a list for easy access or clear the recent resources _(ie if you are going to do a presentation)_ - this is how you can do it.\\n\\nThe Azure portal has a service called: Recent, to access it.\\n\\n1.

If it is - then the Virtual Machine isn\'t started; if it isn\'t, then the virtual machine is started.\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\nToday, we are going to set up an Azure Automation runbook, triggered by a scheduled will go through the following steps:\\n\\n1. On a schedule _(7 AM, it will trigger an Azure Automation runbook)_\\n2. The Azure Automation runbook will do a lookup to an external API, in this case, AbstractApi.\\n3. The runbook will check the date and detect if it falls on a Public Holiday; if it is a Public Holiday, it will exit the Azure Automation runbook; if it is a standard workday, it will start the Virtual Machine.\\n\\nTo do this, we need a few resources.\\n\\n* [Azure Automation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"What is Azure Automation?\\") Account\\n* Azure Automation [runbook](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-runbook-types?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure Automation runbook types\\") _(I will supply a PowerShell runbook below)_\\n* [AbstractAPI ](https://www.abstractapi.com/ \\"Automate routine dev work with Abstract\'s suite of APIs\\") API Key\\n\\nAnd, of course, \'Contributor\' rights to the Microsoft Azure subscription to create the resources and the schedule, along with setting up the System Managed identity to grant the Azure Automation account access to start the Virtual Machine.\\n\\nWe will set up this from scratch using the Azure Portal and use an already created PowerShell Azure Automation runbook.\\n\\n### Deploy Start VM Solution\\n\\n#### Setup Azure Automation Account\\n\\n##### Create Azure Automation Account\\n\\nFirst, we need an [Azure Automation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-create-standalone-account?tabs=azureportal&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Create a standalone Azure Automation account\\") resource.\\n\\n 1. Log into the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\").\\n 2. Click **+ Create a resource.**\\n 3. Type in **automation**\\n 4. Select **Create** under Automation, and select **Automation.**\\n 5. ![Create Azure Automation Account](/uploads/azureportal-create-automation.jpg \\"Create Azure Automation Account\\")\\n 6. Select your **subscription**\\n 7. Select your **Resource Group** or Create one if you don\'t already have one _(I recommend placing your automation resources in an Azure Management or Automation resource group, this will also contain your Runbooks)_\\n 8. Select your **region**\\n 9. ![Create Azure Automation Account](/uploads/azureportal-create-automation_basics.jpg \\"Create Azure Automation Account\\")\\n10. Select **Next**\\n11. Make sure: **System assigned** is selected for Managed identities _(this will be required for giving your automation account permissions to deallocate your Virtual Machine, but it can be enabled later if you already have an Azure Automation account)_.\\n12. Click **Next**\\n13. Leave Network connectivity as default (**Public access**)\\n14. Click **Next**\\n15. **Enter** in appropriate **tags**\\n16. ![Create Azure Automation Account](/uploads/azureportal-create-automation_tags.jpg \\"Create Azure Automation Account\\")\\n17. Click **Review + Create**\\n18. After validation has passed, select **Create**\\n\\n##### Configure System Identity\\n\\nNow that we have our Azure Automation account, its time to set up the System Managed Identity and grant it the following roles:\\n\\n* Virtual Machine Contributor _(to deallocate the Virtual Machine)_\\n\\nYou can set up a custom role to be least privileged and use that instead. But in this article, we will stick to the built-in roles.\\n\\n 1. Log into the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\").\\n 2. Navigate to your Azure **Automation account**\\n 3. Click on: **Identity**\\n 4. Make sure that the **System assigned** toggle is: **On** and click **Azure role assignments.**\\n 5. ![Azure Automation Account managed identity](/uploads/azureportal-automation_managedidentity.jpg \\"Azure Automation Account managed identity\\")\\n 6. Click **+ Add role assignments**\\n 7. Select the **Subscription** _(make sure this subscription matches the same subscription your Virtual Machines are in)_\\n 8. Select Role: **Virtual Machine Contributor**\\n 9. Click **Save**\\n10. Click **Refresh** _(it may take a few seconds to update the Portal, so if it is blank - give it 10 seconds and try again)_.\\n11. You have now set up the System Managed identity and granted it the roles necessary to execute the automation.\\n\\n##### Setup Abstract API Key\\n\\nNow we need to create an API key, which will be used in the runbook to start the Virtual Machine, the API key will allow connections to the Abstract API to retrieve public Holliday information.\\n\\n1. Create an [**Abstract API**](https://www.abstractapi.com/ \\"Abstract API\\") account\\n2. **Log in** to the newly created account\\n3. On the left-hand navigation bar, click on **Holidays**\\n4. ![](/uploads/abstractapi_navigation.png)\\n5. Click on \'**Try it out**\\n6. **Copy** the **API key**\\n7. ![Abstract API - API Key](/uploads/abstractapi_key.png \\"Abstract API - API Key\\")\\n8. Copy the API key, as we will need it for the next steps.\\n\\n##### Import Runbook\\n\\nNow that the modules have been imported into your Azure Automation account, it is time to import the Azure Automation runbook.\\n\\n 1. Log into the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\").\\n 2. Navigate to your Azure **Automation account**\\n 3. Click on **Runbooks**\\n 4. Click **+ Create a runbook**\\n 5. Specify a **name** _(i.e. Start-AzureVirtualMachine)_\\n 6. Select Runbook type of **PowerShell**\\n    1. A select Runtime version of: **5.1** _(7.1 works as well)._\\n 7. Type in a **Description** that explains the runbook _(this isn\'t mandatory, but like Tags is recommended, this is an opportunity to indicate to others what it is for and who set it up)_\\n 8. ![](/uploads/azure-createazurerunbook.png)\\n 9. Click **Create**\\n10. Now you will be greeted with a blank edit pane; paste in the Runbook from below:\\n\\n```powershell title=\\"Start-AzureVirtualMachine.ps1\\"\\n#requires -Version 3.0 -Modules Az.Accounts, Az.Resources\\n<#\\n    .SYNOPSIS\\n    PowerShell Azure Automation Runbook for Starting/Stopping Virtual Machines. \\n    .AUTHOR\\n    Luke Murray (https://github.com/lukemurraynz/)\\n    .VERSION\\n    1.0 - 28/04/22 - script versioned to \'1.0\'.\\n    .DESCRIPTION\\n    1. The script first checks if today is a holiday by making a call to the Abstract API.\\n    The Abstract API returns a JSON object containing the holiday name and (optional) description.\\n    The script checks if the name property is null. If it is not null, the script displays a message indicating that today is a holiday.\\n    If the name property is null, the script displays a message indicating that today is not a holiday.\\n    2. The script then checks if the virtual machine is running or not. If it is running, the script will stop the virtual machine.\\n    If it is not running, the script will start the virtual machine, depending on the Shutdown tag value\\n#>\\n\\nParam(\\n  [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]\\n  [String]\\n  $TagName,\\n  [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]\\n     \\n  [String]\\n  $TagValue,\\n  [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]\\n  [Boolean]\\n  $Shutdown\\n)\\n\\n$CountryCode = \'NZ\'\\n\\n$tDate =(Get-Date).ToUniversalTime()\\n$tz = [System.TimeZoneInfo]::FindSystemTimeZoneById(\\"New Zealand Standard Time\\")\\n$Date  = [System.TimeZoneInfo]::ConvertTimeFromUtc($tDate, $tz)\\n\\n\\n$API = Get-AutomationVariable -Name AbstractApiKey\\n$Holiday = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri (\'https://holidays.abstractapi.com/v1/?api_key={0}&country={1}&year={2}&month={3}&day={4}\' -f $API, $CountryCode, $Date.Year, $Date.Month, $Date.Day)\\n\\n$Holidays = $Holiday.Content\\n$Holidays = $Holidays | ConvertFrom-Json\\n\\nIF ($null -ne $Holidays.name) \\n{\\n  Write-Output -InputObject (\\"Today is a holiday.

You can use the IP [geolocation API](https://app.abstractapi.com/api/ip-geolocation/tester \\"IP geolocation API\\") in Abstract API to do a live test, which will give you your country code. Feel free to amend the Write-Output messages to make sense for your environment.\\n13. Click **Save**\\n14. ![Azure Runbook - PowerShell](/uploads/azurerunbook_publishedsource.png \\"Azure Runbook - PowerShell\\")\\n15. Click **Publish** _(so the runbook is actually in production and can be used)_\\n16. You can select View or Edit at any stage, but you have now imported the Azure Automation runbook!\\n\\n##### Setup Variables\\n\\nNow that the Azure runbook has been imported, we need to set up the variables, which include the API key.\\n\\n 1. Log into the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\").\\n 2. Navigate to your Azure **Automation account**\\n 3. Click **Variables**\\n 4. Click **+ Add a variable**\\n 5. **Create** a Variable named: **AbstractApiKey** _(this needs to match the variable name as part of the \'Get-AutomationVariable\' cmdlet)_.\\n 6. Enter in a **description**\\n 7. Select **String**\\n 8. **Enter** in the **API** key you retrieved earlier from Abstract API.\\n 9. ![Azure Automation - Variables](/uploads/azure-azautomate_variables.png)\\n10. Click **Save**\\n\\n##### Setup Schedule\\n\\nNow that the variables have been set up, we need to set up the schedule. This is the schedule that will be used to start the Virtual Machine. In the example below we are going to use a Standard Monday -> Friday work week, but adjust the time and date for when you need to start the virtual machine up.\\n\\n 1. Log into the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\").\\n 2. Navigate to your Azure **Automation account**\\n 3. Click **Schedule**\\n 4. Click **+ Add a schedule**\\n 5. **Type** in a **name** for the **schedule** _(ie Azure Virtual Machine - Start)_.\\n 6. Type in a **Description**\\n 7. **Select** the **Start Date** to match when you want to start the Schedule _(ie first Monday of the week)_.\\n 8. **Select** your **Timezone**, so that the script runs on the right time/date which makes your timezone.\\n 9. For Recurrance, specify: **Recurring**\\n10. Set it to Recur every: **1 Day**\\n11. Check **Monday**, **Tuesday**, **Wednesday**, **Thursday**, and **Friday**\\n12. Leave Saturday and Sunday unchecked.\\n13. Click **Create**\\n14. Now that the Schedule has been created, we need to bind it to a Runbook\\n15. On the Automation account blade, click on **Runbooks**\\n16. Click on your \'Start Azure Virtual Machine\' runbook\\n17. Select **Schedules**\\n18. Click **Add a Schedule**\\n19. Press: **Link a schedule to your runbook**\\n20. Select **your** newly created **Schedule**\\n21. For the Tag Name, select **Shutdown**\\n22. For the Tag Value name, Select **Yes**\\n23. For Shutdown, select **false**\\n24. Click **Ok**\\n25. Your schedule has now been configured and the runbook will run the next time it matches your scheduled date and time.\\n\\n##### Configure Tags\\n\\nThe runbook is written, so it doesn\'t need to be adjusted for future machines and making changes on the fly, this relies on each Virtual Machine that you want started to be started using the Runbook to be tagged.\\n\\n1. Log into the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\").\\n2. Navigate to your Azure **Virtual Machine**\\n3. Click **Tags**\\n4. **Add the following tag**:\\n\\n| Tag Key | Tag Value |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Shutdown | Yes |\\n\\nCongratulations, the next time your schedule triggers, every runbook with the Shutdown tag will be started, according to your schedule, and workday. If it\'s a Public Holiday or a Weekend, the Virtual Machine will remain off - saving cost."},{"id":"/2022/06/02/microsoft-azure-naming-conventions","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022/06/02/microsoft-azure-naming-conventions","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-02-microsoft-azure-naming-conventions.md","title":"Microsoft Azure Naming Conventions","description":"Accurately representing and naming your resources is essential for security purposes.","date":"2022-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":7.94,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"date":"2022-06-02 00:00:00 +1200","title":"Microsoft Azure Naming Conventions","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"/uploads/azurenaming.png"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Turn on a Azure Virtual Machine using Azure Automation","permalink":"/azure/turn-on-a-azure-virtual-machine-using-azure-automation"},"nextItem":{"title":"Microsoft Azure Tagging Conventions","permalink":"/azure/microsoft-azure-tagging-conventions"}},"content":"Accurately representing and naming your resources is essential for security purposes.\\n\\nIn a security incident, it is critical to identify affected systems quickly, what functions those systems support, and the potential business impact.\\n\\nA useful naming convention composes resource names from important information about each resource.

Use naming and tagging standards to organize your resources for these reasons:\\n\\n* **Resource management**: Your IT teams will need to quickly locate resources associated with specific workloads, environments, ownership groups, or other important information. Organizing resources is critical to assigning organizational roles and access permissions for resource management.\\n* **Cost management and optimization**: Making business groups aware of cloud resource consumption requires IT to understand each team\'s resources and workloads.\\n* **Operations management**: Visibility for the operations management team regarding business commitments and SLAs is an essential aspect of ongoing operations.\\n* **Security:** Classification of data and security impact is a vital data point for the team when breaches or other security issues arise.\\n* **Governance and regulatory compliance:** Maintaining consistency across resources helps identify deviation from agreed-upon policies.\\n* **Automation:** In addition to making resources easier for IT to manage, a proper organizational scheme allows you to take advantage of automation as part of resource creation, operational monitoring, and the result of DevOps processes.\\n\\n**Workload optimization:** Tagging can help identify patterns and resolve broad issues. A tag can also help determine the assets required to support a single workload. Tagging all assets associated with each workload enables a more profound analysis of your mission-critical workloads to make sound architectural decisions.\\n\\n* [Use tags to organize your Azure resources and management hierarchy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources?tabs=json&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Use tags to organize your Azure resources and management hierarchy\\")\\n\\n### Tagging Types\\n\\nThe common tagging patterns listed below provide examples of how tagging can be used to organize cloud assets. These patterns are not meant to be exclusive and can be used in parallel, providing multiple ways of organizing assets based on your company\'s needs.\\n\\n| Tag type | Examples | Description |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Functional | app = catalogsearch1 tier = web webserver = apache env = prod env = staging env = dev | Categorize resources in relation to their purpose within a workload, what environment they have been deployed to, or other functionality and operational details. |\\n| Classification | confidentiality = private SLA = 24hours | Classifies a resource by how it is used and what policies apply to it. |\\n| Accounting | department = finance program = business-initiative region = northamerica | Allows a resource to be associated with specific groups within an organization for billing purposes. |\\n| Partnership | owner = jsmith contactalias = catsearchowners stakeholders = user1; user2; user3 | Provides information about what people (outside of IT) are related or otherwise affected by the resource. |\\n| Purpose | businessprocess = support businessimpact = moderate revenueimpact = high | Aligns resources to business functions to better support investment decisions. |\\n\\n### Tagging Baselines\\n\\nTag at the Resource Group level and then have an Azure policy implemented that tags the resources in that Resource Group with the appropriate tags.\\n\\n| Tag Name | Value | Tag Type | Description | Example |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| Environment | Production Development Sandbox | Functional | Tags the resources with the Environment Tag. This can be used to determine if a resource is Production, Development or Sandbox. | Environment: Production |\\n| Creator | {CreatorName} | Partnership | Tags the resource with the name of who created the resource. This can be used to determine who created the resource to be able to get more information. | Creator: Luke Murray |\\n| CreatedDate | {CreatedDate} | Purpose | Tags the resource with the Date/Time when the resource was created. This can be used to determine how old a resource is, which can be used to look at new functionality on created resources or check if resources are still required. | CreatedDate: 10:00 PM 03/06/2022 NZT |\\n| Criticality | P1 P2 P3 | Purpose | Tags the resources with the criticality of the resources, i.e., if critical, then it is P1. This can be used to determine whether resources need to be highly available, whether changes can be made during or out of business hours. | Criticality:P1 |\\n| SupportedBy | {TeamName} | Partnership | Tags the resources with the team/person or company who supports the resources, whether it is internally supported by the company or outsourced. | SupportedBy:Company |\\n| RequesterName | {Requestor}-{CompanyName) | Partnership | Tags the resources with the user that requested the creation of the resources. | RequesterName:Project Manager |\\n| BillTo | {BillTo} | Accounting | Tags the resources with the cost centre or project codes who will pay for the resources. | BillTo:AppTransformationProject1 |\\n| AutoShutDown | Yes | Functional | This is an Automation functional tag, i.e., tag the resource (Virtual Machine) with a tagging code which will automatically Shut down and Start-up the Virtual Machine at specified times. | AutoShutDown:Yes |\\n| ApplicationName | {ProjectName} | Partnership | Tags the resource with the name of the project or what the resources in the resource group are for. | ApplicationName:AzureVirtualDesktopSH |\\n| Business Unit | {BusinessUnit} | Partnership | Tags the resource with the name of the Business Unit or Company that owns the resources. | BusinessUnit:Finance |\\n| Snapshot | True | Functional | This is an Automation functional tag, i.e., tag the resource (Disk) with a tagging code which can create daily snapshots of disks. | Snapshot:True |"},{"id":"/2022/05/31/my-path-to-the-mvp-award","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022/05/31/my-path-to-the-mvp-award","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-31-my-path-to-the-mvp-award.md","title":"My path to the Microsoft MVP Award","description":"The path to becoming a Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) is not as linear as some might think, others have a goal to receive the Microsoft MVP Award, and others have a passion for technology that shows in community activities such as speaking or user groups, helping others on forums, and helping to maintain documentation and helping others be up-to-speed with the ever changing ecosystem that is the Microsoft stack -

In fact, the flexibility and power provided by the cloud mean that it is even more important to have clear requirements from business stakeholders; otherwise, you could end up solving problems that don\'t exist, missing an important design decision, or going beyond the available budget by adding unnecessary resiliency.\\n\\n![Requirements and Architecture](/uploads/requirementsandarchitecture.png \\"Requirements and Architecture\\")\\n\\n#### Non-functional requirements _(NFRs)_\\n\\nBelow is a short list of NFRs (not exhaustive) that may be provided by the business to help inform the design of a solution.\\n\\n##### **Reliability requirements**\\n\\n* Service level agreement (SLA)\\n* Uptime objective\\n* Recovery time objective (RTO)\\n* Recovery point objective (RPO)\\n* Recoverability\\n\\n##### **Security requirements**\\n\\n* Geographical location\\n* Compliance and legislation\\n* Identity and access management\\n* Privacy\\n* Data Integrity\\n* Public or private endpoints (or both)\\n* OWASP\\n* Hybrid connectivity\\n* DDOS\\n\\n##### **Performance requirements**\\n\\n* Peak throughput, e.g., Requests per minute (RPM), active users\\n* Business plan for growth\\n* UX metrics (e.g., Page load time)\\n* Asynchronous vs Synchronous operations\\n* Workload profile (predictable, unpredictable, peak time of day)\\n* Scalability\\n* Data estate size and growth rate\\n* Time-to-live (TTL) of reports and views (real-time vs eventual consistency)\\n\\n##### **Operational requirements**\\n\\n* Prod and non-prod environments (Dev/Test, QA, Pre-prod, Prod)\\n* Release frequency (hours / days / months)\\n* Time to onboard (new customer)\\n* Licensing\\n* Cost _(Management)_\\n* Manageability\\n\\n##### **Cost optimization**\\n\\n* Cost per user\\n* Target hosting costs as a percentage of revenue\\n* Pricing model\\n* Tenancy model\\n\\n##### **Azure SLAs**\\n\\n* Familiarize yourself with [Azure service-level agreements](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/support/legal/sla/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\" Service-level agreements\\")\\n* An Azure Service-level Agreement (SLA) can also be read as a minimum service-level objective (SLO).\\n* An SLA is a financial guarantee, not an absolute guarantee\\n* Read the SLA details carefully, particularly the definition of \\"downtime\\" for each service, which gives important hints about failure modes\\n\\nFor example, in the [SLA for Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/support/legal/sla/azure-sql-database/v1_8/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\" SLA for Azure SQL Database\\"), \\"downtime\\" is defined as:\\n\\n_\\"The total accumulated Deployment Minutes across all Databases in a given Microsoft Azure subscription during which the Database is unavailable. A minute is considered unavailable for a given Database if all continuous attempts by Customer to establish a connection to the Database within the minute fail.\\"_\\n\\nThe Azure SQL Database team expect almost all outages to be transient (brief and non-recurring). Therefore, the retry pattern should be used to continuously retry for up to a minute. This is typical in cloud services; retry has been the default behaviour in ADO.NET since .NET Framework 4.6.1.\\n\\n#### External Resources\\n\\nFinally, resources such as the Azure Architecture Center, Cloud Adoption and Well-Architected Framework can help with thinking around the design and building blocks of your architecture\\n\\n* [**Azure Architecture Center**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure Architecture Center\\")\\n* [**Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework\\")\\n* [**Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure\\")"},{"id":"/2022/05/27/how-to-contribute-to-microsoft-documentation","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022/05/27/how-to-contribute-to-microsoft-documentation","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-27-how-to-contribute-to-microsoft-documentation.md","title":"How to contribute to Microsoft documentation","description":"Did you know you can contribute to Microsoft documentation (ms docs)?","date":"2022-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Misc","permalink":"/tags/misc"}],"readingTime":1.08,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"How to contribute to Microsoft documentation","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Misc"],"date":"2022-05-27 00:00:00 +1300","toc":false,"header":{"teaser":"/uploads/msdocs_contribute_issue.png"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Architecture in the Cloud","permalink":"/azure/architecture-in-the-cloud"},"nextItem":{"title":"Deallocate \'Stopped\' Virtual Machines using Azure Automation","permalink":"/2022/05/12/deallocate-stopped-virtual-machines-using-azure-automation"}},"content":"Did you know you can contribute to Microsoft documentation _(ms docs)_?\\n\\nSuppose you see something not quite right, technically or even if the document\'s readability doesn\'t look right!

Also called PoweredOff state or Stopped (Allocated). This can be result of invoking the PowerOff API operation or invoking shutdown from within the guest OS. The Stopped state may also be observed briefly during VM creation or while starting a VM from Deallocated state. | Billed |\\n| Deallocating | This is the transitional state between running and deallocated. | Not billed |\\n| Deallocated | The Virtual Machine has released the lease on the underlying hardware and is completely powered off. This state is also referred to as Stopped (Deallocated). | Not billed |\\n\\nSuppose a Virtual Machine is not being used. In that case, turning off a Virtual Machine from the Microsoft Azure Portal _(or programmatically via_ [_PowerShell_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure PowerShell Documentation\\")_/_[_Azure CLI_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"How to install the Azure CLI\\")_)_ is recommended to ensure that the Virtual Machine is deallocated and its affinity on the host has been released.\\n\\n![Microsoft Azure - Virtual Machine Power States](/uploads/azvm-power-states.png \\"Microsoft Azure - Virtual Machine Power States\\")\\n\\nHowever, you need to know this, and those new to Microsoft Azure, or users who don\'t have [Virtual Machine Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure built-in roles\\") rights to deallocate a Virtual Machine, may simply shut down the operating system, leaving the Virtual Machine in a \'Stopped\' state, but still tied to an underlying Azure host and incurring cost.\\n\\nOur solution can help; by triggering an Alert when a Virtual Machine becomes unavailable due to a user-initiated shutdown, we can then start an [Azure Automation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) runbook to deallocate the Virtual Machine.\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\nToday, we are going to set up an Azure Automation runbook, triggered by a Resource Health alert that will go through the following steps:\\n\\n1. User shutdowns Virtual Machine from within the Operating System\\n2. The Virtual Machine enters an unavailable state\\n3. A Resource Alert is triggered when the Virtual Machine becomes unavailable (after being available) by a user initiated event\\n4. The Alert triggers a Webhook to an Azure Automation runbook\\n5. Using permissions assigned to the Azure Automation account through a System Managed Identity connects to Microsoft Azure and checks the VM state; if the Virtual Machine state is still \'Stopped\', then deallocate the virtual machine.\\n6. Then finally, resolve the triggered alert.\\n\\nTo do this, we need a few resources.\\n\\n* Azure Automation Account\\n* Az.AlertsManagement module in the Azure Automation account\\n* Az.Accounts module _(updated in the Azure Automation account)_\\n* Azure Automation runbook _(I will supply this below)_\\n* Resource Health Alert\\n* Webhook _(to trigger to the runbook and pass the JSON from the alert)_\\n\\nAnd, of course, \'Contributor\' rights to the Microsoft Azure subscription to provide the resources and the alerts and resources and set up the system managed identity.\\n\\nWe will set up this from scratch using the Azure Portal and an already created PowerShell Azure Automation runbook.\\n\\n### Deploy Deallocate Solution\\n\\n#### Setup Azure Automation Account\\n\\n##### Create Azure Automation Account\\n\\nFirst, we need an [Azure Automation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-create-standalone-account?tabs=azureportal&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Create a standalone Azure Automation account\\") resource.\\n\\n 1. Log into the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\").\\n 2. Click **+ Create a resource.**\\n 3. Type in **automation**\\n 4. Select **Create** under Automation, and select **Automation.**\\n 5. ![Create Azure Automation Account](/uploads/azureportal-create-automation.jpg \\"Create Azure Automation Account\\")\\n 6. Select your **subscription**\\n 7. Select your **Resource Group** or Create one if you don\'t already have one _(I recommend placing your automation resources in an Azure Management or Automation resource group, this will also contain your Runbooks)_\\n 8. Select your **region**\\n 9. ![Create Azure Automation Account](/uploads/azureportal-create-automation_basics.jpg \\"Create Azure Automation Account\\")\\n10. Select **Next**\\n11. Make sure: **System assigned** is selected for Managed identities _(this will be required for giving your automation account permissions to deallocate your Virtual Machine, but it can be enabled later if you already have an Azure Automation account)_.\\n12. Click **Next**\\n13. Leave Network connectivity as default (**Public access**)\\n14. Click **Next**\\n15. **Enter** in appropriate **tags**\\n16. ![Create Azure Automation Account](/uploads/azureportal-create-automation_tags.jpg \\"Create Azure Automation Account\\")\\n17. Click **Review + Create**\\n18. After validation has passed, select **Create**\\n\\n##### Configure System Identity\\n\\nNow that we have our Azure Automation account, its time to set up the System Managed Identity and grant it the following roles:\\n\\n* Virtual Machine Contributor _(to deallocate the Virtual Machine)_\\n* Monitoring Contributor _(to close the Azure Alert)_\\n\\nYou can set up a custom role to be least privileged and use that instead. But in this article, we will stick to the built-in roles. \\n\\n 1. Log into the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\").\\n 2. Navigate to your Azure **Automation account**\\n 3. Click on: **Identity**\\n 4. Make sure that the **System assigned** toggle is: **On** and click **Azure role assignments.**\\n 5. ![Azure Automation Account managed identity](/uploads/azureportal-automation_managedidentity.jpg \\"Azure Automation Account managed identity\\")\\n 6. Click **+ Add role assignments**\\n 7. Select the **Subscription** _(make sure this subscription matches the same subscription your Virtual Machines are in)_\\n 8. Select Role: **Virtual Machine Contributor**\\n 9. Click **Save**\\n10. Now we repeat the same process for **Monitoring Contributor**\\n11. lick **+ Add role assignments**\\n12. Select the **Subscription** _(make sure this subscription matches the same subscription your Virtual Machines are in)_\\n13. Select Role: **Monitoring Contributor**\\n14. Click **Save**\\n15. Click **Refresh** _(it may take a few seconds to update the Portal, so if it is blank - give it 10 seconds and try again)_.\\n16. You have now set up the System Managed identity and granted it the roles necessary to execute the automation.\\n\\n##### Import Modules\\n\\nWe will use the Azure Runbook and use a few Azure PowerShell Modules; by default, Azure Automation has the base Azure PowerShell modules, but we will need to add [Az.AlertsManagement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.alertsmanagement/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Az.AlertsManagement\\"), and update the Az.Accounts as required as a pre-requisite for Az.AlertsManagement.\\n\\n 1. Log into the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\").\\n 2. Navigate to your Azure **Automation account**\\n 3. Click on **Modules**\\n 4. Click on **+ Add a module**\\n 5. Click on **Browse from Gallery**\\n 6. Click: **Click here to browse from the gallery**\\n 7. Type in: **Az.Accounts**\\n 8. Press **Enter**\\n 9. Click on **Az.Accounts**\\n10. Click **Select**\\n11. ![Import Az.Accounts module](/uploads/azureportal-automation_modules_az-accounts.jpg \\"Import Az.Accounts module\\")\\n12. Make sure that the Runtime version is: **5.1** \\n13. Click **Import**\\n14. Now that the Az.Accounts have been updated, and it\'s time to import Az.AlertsManagement!\\n15. Click on **Modules**\\n16. Click on **+ Add a module**\\n17. Click on **Browse from Gallery**\\n18. Click: **Click here to browse from the gallery**\\n19. Type in: **Az.AlertsManagement** _(note its Alert**s)**_\\n20. Click **Az.AlertsManagement**\\n21. ![Az.AlertsManagement module](/uploads/azureportal-automation_modules_az-alertsmanagement.jpg \\"Az.AlertsManagement module\\")\\n22. Click **Select**\\n23. Make sure that the Runtime version is: **5.1** \\n24. Click **Import** _(if you get an error, make sure that Az.Accounts has been updated, through the Gallery import as above)_\\n25. Now you have successfully added the dependent modules!\\n\\n##### Import Runbook\\n\\nNow that the modules have been imported into your Azure Automation account, it is time to import the Azure Automation runbook.\\n\\n 1. Log into the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\").\\n 2. Navigate to your Azure **Automation account**\\n 3. Click on **Runbooks**\\n 4. Click **+ Create a runbook**\\n 5. Specify a **name** _(i.e. Deallocate-AzureVirtualMachine)_\\n 6. Select Runbook type of: **PowerShell**\\n 7. Select Runtime version of: **5.1**\\n 8. Type in a **Description** that explains the runbook _(this isn\'t mandatory, but like Tags is recommended, this is an opportunity to indicate to others what it is for and who set it up)_\\n 9. ![Create Azure Runbook](/uploads/azureportal-runbook-create.jpg \\"Create Azure Runbook\\")\\n10. Click **Create**\\n11. Now you will be greeted with a blank edit pane; paste in the Runbook from below:\\n\\n```powershell title=\\"Deallocate-AzureVirtualMachine.ps1\\"\\n#requires -Version 3.0 -Modules Az.Accounts, Az.AlertsManagement\\n<#\\n    .SYNOPSIS\\n    PowerShell Azure Automation Runbook for Stopping Virtual Machines, that have been Shutdown within the Windows Operating System (Stopped and not Deallocated). \\n    .AUTHOR\\n    Luke Murray (https://github.com/lukemurraynz/)\\n#>\\n\\n[OutputType(\'PSAzureOperationResponse\')]\\nparam ( \\n    [Parameter(Mandatory = $true, HelpMessage = \'Data from the WebHook/Azure Alert\')][Object]$WebhookData\\n)\\n\\nImport-Module Az.AlertsManagement\\n$ErrorActionPreference = \'stop\'\\n\\n# Get the data object from WebhookData\\n$WebhookData = $WebhookData.RequestBody\\nWrite-Output -InputObject $WebhookData \\n$Schema = $WebhookData | ConvertFrom-Json\\n\\n#Sets the Webhook data into object\\n$Essentials = [object] ($Schema.data).essentials\\nWrite-Output -InputObject $Essentials \\n\\n# Get the first target only as this script doesn\'t handle multiple and and export variables for the resource.\\n$alertIdArray = (($Essentials.alertId)).Split(\'/\')\\n$alertTargetIdArray = (($Essentials.alertTargetIds)[0]).Split(\'/\')\\n$alertid =  ($alertIdArray)[6]\\n$SubId = ($alertTargetIdArray)[2]\\n$ResourceGroupName = ($alertTargetIdArray)[4]\\n$ResourceType = ($alertTargetIdArray)[6] + \'/\' + ($alertTargetIdArray)[7]\\n$ResourceName = ($alertTargetIdArray)[-1]\\n$status = $Essentials.monitorCondition\\nWrite-Output -InputObject $alertTargetIdArray\\nWrite-Output  -InputObject \\"status: $status\\" -Verbose\\n\\n#Sets VM shutdown\\nif (($status -eq \'Activated\') -or ($status -eq \'Fired\')) {\\n    $status = $Essentials.monitorCondition\\n    Write-Output -InputObject \\"resourceType: $ResourceType\\" -Verbose\\n    Write-Output  -InputObject \\"resourceName: $ResourceName\\" -Verbose\\n    Write-Output  -InputObject \\"resourceGroupName: $ResourceGroupName\\" -Verbose\\n    Write-Output  -InputObject \\"subscriptionId: $SubId\\" -Verbose\\n\\n    # Determine code path depending on the resourceType\\n    if ($ResourceType -eq \'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines\') {\\n        # This is an Resource Manager VM\\n        Write-Output  -InputObject \'This is an Resource Manager VM.\' -Verbose\\n\\n        # Ensures you do not inherit an AzContext in your runbook\\n        Disable-AzContextAutosave -Scope Process\\n\\n        # Connect to Azure with system-assigned managed identity\\n        $AzureContext = (Connect-AzAccount -Identity).context\\n\\n        # set and store context\\n        $AzureContext = Set-AzContext -SubscriptionName $AzureContext.Subscription -DefaultProfile $AzureContext\\n        Write-Output   -InputObject $AzureContext \\n        #Checks Azure VM status\\n        $VMStatus = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $ResourceName -Status\\n\\n        Write-Output  -InputObject $VMStatus\\n        If ($VMStatus.Statuses[1].Code -eq \'PowerState/stopped\') {\\n            Write-Output  -InputObject \\"Stopping the VM, it was Shutdown without being Deallocated - $ResourceName - in resource group - $ResourceGroupName\\" -Verbose\\n            Stop-AzVM -Name $ResourceName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -DefaultProfile $AzureContext -Force -Verbose\\n      \\n            #Check VM Status after deallocation\\n            $VMStatus = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $ResourceName -Status -Verbose\\n            \\n            Write-Output  -InputObject $VMStatus\\n\\n            If ($VMStatus.Statuses[1].Code -eq \'PowerState/deallocated\') {\\n                #Closes Alert\\n                Write-Output  -InputObject $VMStatus.Statuses[1].Code\\n                Write-Output  -InputObject $alertid \\n                Get-AzAlert -AlertId $alertid  -verbose -DefaultProfile $AzureContext\\n                Get-AzAlert -AlertId $alertid  -verbose -DefaultProfile $AzureContext | Update-AzAlertState -State \'Closed\' -Verbose -DefaultProfile $AzureContext\\n            }\\n        }\\n             \\n        Elseif ($VMStatus.Statuses[1].Code -eq \'PowerState/deallocated\') {\\n            Write-Output  -InputObject \'Already deallocated\' -Verbose\\n        }\\n\\n        Elseif ($VMStatus.Statuses[1].Code -eq \'PowerState/running\') {\\n            Write-Output  -InputObject \'VM running.

Click **Publish** _(so the runbook is actually in production and can be used)_\\n16. You can select View or Edit at any stage, but you have now imported the Azure Automation runbook!\\n\\n##### Setup Webhook\\n\\nNow that the Azure runbook has been imported, we need to set up a Webhook for the Alert to trigger and start the runbook.\\n\\n 1. Log into the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\").\\n 2. Navigate to your Azure **Automation account**\\n 3. Click on **Runbooks**\\n 4. **Click** on the **runbook** you just imported _(i.e. Deallocate-AzureVirtualMachine)_\\n 5. Click on **Add webhook**\\n 6. Click **Create a new webhook**\\n 7. **Enter** a **name** for the webhook\\n 8. Make sure it is **Enabled**\\n 9. You can edit the expiry date to match your security requirements; make sure you **record** the expiry date, as it will need to be renewed before it expires.\\n10. **Copy** the **URL** and paste it somewhere safe _(you won\'t see this again! and you need it for the next steps)_\\n11. ![Create Azure webhook](/uploads/azureportal-webhook-create.jpg \\"Create Azure webhook\\")\\n12. Click **Ok**\\n13. Click on **Configure parameters and run settings.**\\n14. Because we will be taking in dynamic data from an Azure Alert, enter in: **\\\\[EmptyString\\\\]**\\n15. Click **Ok**\\n16. Click **Create**\\n17. You have now set up the webhook _(make sure you have saved the URL from the earlier step as you will need it in the following steps)!_\\n\\n#### Setup Alert & Action Group\\n\\nNow that the Automation framework has been created with the Azure Automation account, runbook and webhook, we now need a way to detect if a Virtual Machine has been Stopped; this is where a Resource Health alert will come in.\\n\\n 1. Log into the [**Microsoft Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\").\\n 2. Navigate to: [**Monitor**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring/AzureMonitoringBrowseBlade/overview)\\n 3. Click on **Service Health**\\n 4. Select **Resource Health**\\n 5. Select **+ Add resource health alert**\\n 6. Select your **subscription**\\n 7. Select **Virtual machine** for Resource Type\\n 8. You can target specific Resource Groups for your alert _(and, as such, your automation)_ or **select all.**\\n 9. Check **Include all future resource groups**\\n10. Check **include all future resources**\\n11. Under the Alert conditions, make sure **Event Status** is: **All selected**\\n12. Set Current resource status to **Unavailable**\\n13. Set Previous resource status to **All selected**\\n14. For reason type, select: **User initiated** and **unknown**\\n15. ![Create Azure Resource Health Alert](/uploads/azureportal-alert-create.jpg \\"Create Azure Resource Health Alert\\")\\n16. Now that we have the Alert rule configured, we need to set up an Action group. That will get triggered when the alert gets fired.\\n17. Click **Select Action groups.**\\n18. Click **+ Create action group**\\n19. **Select** your subscription and **resource group** _(this is where the Action alert will go, I recommend your Azure Management/Monitoring resource group that may have a Log Analytics workspace as an example)_.\\n20. Give your Action Group a **name**, i.e. AzureAutomateActionGroup\\n21. The display name will be automatically generated, but feel free to adjust it to suit your naming convention\\n22. Click **Next: Notifications**\\n23. Under **Notifications**, you can trigger an **email alert**, which can be handy in determining how often the runbook runs. This can be modified and removed if it is running, especially during testing.\\n24. Click **Next: Actions**\\n25. Under Action Type, select **Webhook**\\n26. **Paste** in the **URI** created earlier when setting up the Webhook\\n27. Select **Yes** to enable the **common alert schema** (_this is required as the JSON that the runbook is parsing is expecting it to the in the schema, if it isn\'t the runbook will fail)_\\n28. ![Create Azure Action Group](/uploads/azureportal-actiongroup-webhook.jpg \\"Create Azure Action Group\\")\\n29. Click **Ok**\\n30. Give the **webhook** a **name**.\\n31. Click **Review + create** \\n32. Click **Create**\\n33. Finally, enter in an Alert **name** and **description**, specify the resource group for the Alert to go into and click **Save.**\\n\\n### Test Deallocate Solution\\n\\nSo now we have stood up our:\\n\\n* Azure automation account\\n* Alert\\n* Action Group\\n* Azure automation runbook \\n* Webhook\\n\\nIt is time to test! I have a VM called: VM-D01, running Windows _(theoretically, this runbook will also run against Linux workloads, as its relying on the Azure agent to send the correct status to the Azure Logs, but in my testing, it was against Windows workloads)_ in the same subscription that the alert has been deployed against.\\n\\nAs you can see below, I shut down the Virtual Machine. After a few minutes _(be patient, Azure needs to wait for the status of the VM to be triggered)_, an Azure Alert was fired into Azure Monitor, which triggered the webhook and runbook, and the Virtual Machine was deallocated, and the Azure Alert was closed.\\n\\n![Azure deallocate testing](/uploads/deallocatevm.gif \\"Azure deallocate testing\\")"},{"id":"azure/hidden-tags-in-azure","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/hidden-tags-in-azure","source":"@site/blog/2022-05-07-hidden-tags-in-azure.md","title":"Hidden Tags in Azure","description":"Tags in Microsoft Azure are pivotal to resource management, whether it\'s used for reporting or automation.","date":"2022-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":3.495,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Hidden Tags in Azure","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"date":"2022-05-07 00:00:00 +1300","toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"images/iazure-marketplace-banner.png"},"slug":"azure/hidden-tags-in-azure"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Deallocate \'Stopped\' Virtual Machines using Azure Automation","permalink":"/2022/05/12/deallocate-stopped-virtual-machines-using-azure-automation"},"nextItem":{"title":"Azure Arc Bridge - Implementation and Testing","permalink":"/2022/04/20/azure-arc-bridge-implementing-and-testing"}},"content":"[Tags](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources?tabs=json&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Use tags to organize your Azure resources and management hierarchy\\") in Microsoft Azure are pivotal to resource management, whether it\'s used for reporting or automation.\\n\\nBut sometimes, you need that extra bit of information to help discover what resources are for, or you may way to add information to a resource that isn\'t directly displayed in the portal, especially when complex tags are in use that might be used in automation initiatives.\\n\\nThis is where \'hidden\' Azure Tags come in handy.\\n\\nTags starting with the prefix of _\'hidden-\'_ will not be displayed under Tags in the Azure Portal; however, they will be displayed in the resource metadata and utilised by PowerShell and Azure CLI for automation initiatives.\\n\\nExamples are:\\n\\n| Tags | Value |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| hidden-title | Web Server |\\n| hidden-ShutdownAutomation | Yes |\\n\\n### hidden-title\\n\\nAs I mentioned above, every tag with \'hidden-\' in front of it will be hidden in the Azure Portal. However, \'hidden-title\' behaves differently.\\n\\nYou may have noticed that some resources in Azure, especially if the Azure ARM _(Azure Resource Manager)_ creates them and the name is GUID based, has a \'(name)\' around them after the resource name; this is because of the hidden-title tag.\\n\\nThe hidden-title tag is especially useful for being able to pick resources that belong to a specific service or application.\\n\\nAn example is below:\\n\\n![Azure Portal - Hidden Title Tag](/uploads/azureportal_hiddentitle.png \\"Azure Portal - Hidden Title Tag\\")\\n\\nIn this case, I have used the _hidden-title_ of \'Web Server\', allowing me to quickly view what resources may be mapped to my Web Server.\\n\\nYou may notice that the Test-Virtual Machines title, is displayed in the Resource Groups search blade and not in the actual Resource Group, there are some areas of the Portal that will not display the hidden-title tag currently.\\n\\nIf I navigate to my Virtual Machine and click on the Tags blade, all I see is my CreatedBy tag.\\n\\n![Azure Portal - Tags](/uploads/azureportal-hiddentitle-vmtags.png \\"Azure Portal - Tags\\")\\n\\nHowever, if I navigate to the Overview page and click on JSON View, I can see the hidden tags in the resource metadata.\\n\\n![Azure Portal - Resource Tags](/uploads/azureportal-hiddentitle-vmtagsjson.png \\"Azure Portal - Resource Tags\\")\\n\\n### hidden tags\\n\\n#### Azure Portal\\n\\nYou can use the Azure Portal directly to add the Tags to apply hidden tags.\\n\\n![Azure Portal - Add Tags](/uploads/azureportal_hiddentagsadd.png \\"Azure Portal - Add Tags\\")\\n\\nYou can remove the Tag by adding the hidden-tag again and keeping the value empty _(ie blanking out the hidden-title will remove the title)_, but it will still be against the metadata _(Resource Graph)_ as a Tag that exists (as seen in the screenshot below) - it is much cleaner to use PowerShell.\\n\\n![Azure - Resource Tags](/uploads/azureportal_hiddentagsremove.png \\"Azure - Resource Tags\\")\\n\\n#### PowerShell\\n\\nGet-AzTag and Remove-AzTag, do not display the hidden tags, to add and remove the tags, you need to add them through \'Update-AzTag\' and \'Replace\' or \'Merge\' to overwrite the tags, which requires the Resource targetted by Resource ID.\\n\\nA handy snippet to use to add/remove the Tags on individual or multiple resources is:\\n\\n    $replacedTags = @{\\"hidden-title\\" = \\"Web Server\\"; \\"hidden-ShutdownAutomation\\" = \\"Yes\\"}\\n    $resouceGroup = \'vm-dev-rg\'\\n    Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName $resouceGroup | Select-Object ResourceId | Out-GridView -PassThru | Update-AzTag -Tag $replacedTags -Operation Merge\\n\\nThis will snippet will gather all the resources in your Resource Group, then select their Resource IDs; the script will then prompt with a GUI allowing you to select which resources or resources you want to update your tags on, then once you click Ok, it will update the Tags on the resources you selected.\\n\\n![PowerShell - Add Azure Tags](/uploads/powershell_hiddentagsadd.png \\"PowerShell - Add Azure Tags\\")\\n\\nYou may be wondering if the Hidden tags are useful for automation, but if the \'Get-AzTag\' cmdlet doesn\'t work, how can I retrieve the resources?

Create your **Custom Location**, then **enter** in the on-premises **vCenter** details\\n11. ![Azure Arc - vCenter Onboarding](/uploads/azure_arc_vmware_portal_bridge_vcenter.png \\"Azure Arc - vCenter Onboarding\\")\\n12. On the next blade, enter in your appropriate **Tags,** then click **Create**\\n13. Wait for the deployment to complete; this could take 2-5 minutes.\\n14. In the search box up the top, type in: **Azure Arc**\\n15. Click **Azure Arc**\\n16. Click on: **VMware vCenters (preview)**\\n17. You should now see your vSphere instance in a Connected state.\\n18. ![Azure Arc - vCenter](/uploads/azure_arc_vmware_portal_bridge_vcenterdeployed.png \\"Azure Arc - vCenter\\")\\n\\n#### Enable vCenter resources to be managed in Microsoft Azure\\n\\nNow that the Bridge has been created, we need to allow resources _(such as Virtual Machines, Datastores,  Networks)_.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the **Azure Portal**\\n 2. In the search box up the top, type in: **Azure Arc**\\n 3. Click **Azure Arc**\\n 4. Click on: **VMware vCenters (preview)**\\n 5. Click on your **vCenter instance**\\n 6. Under vCenter Inventory, select **Virtual Machines**\\n 7. ![Azure Arc - vCenter](/uploads/azure_arc_vsphere_vm.png \\"Azure Arc - vCenter\\")\\n 8. Select the Virtual Machines you want to enable for management in Azure and click \'**Enable in Azure**\'\\n 9. Select your applicable Subscription and Resource Group (this is where the Azure Arc VM resources will be placed)\\n10. Make sure \'**Enable Guest management**\' is selected.\\n11. Enter in your Administrator _(this is the Admin Username and password of the workloads you want to install the Azure guest management too)_\\n12. ![Azure Arc - On-premises VM](/uploads/azure_arc_vsphere_vmguestagent.png \\"Azure Arc - On-premises VM\\")\\n13. Click **Enable**\\n14. It can take a few minutes to onboard these clients. If it fails, pick a single Virtual Machine and attempt to onboard that.\\n15. You can now repeat the process to onboard Networks, Resource Pools etc.\\n\\n### Manage Virtual Machines in Microsoft Azure\\n\\nNow that you have set up an Azure Arc Bridge and onboarded vCenter resources. You can now see and manage your vCenter Virtual Machines in Azure, examples below.\\n\\n* Ensure that you have VMWare Tools installed and up-to-date to help full functionality, such as Restart, or there may be issues managing these.\\n\\n#### Stop/Stop Virtual Machines\\n\\n![Azure Arc - Start/Stop VM](/uploads/startstopvm-azurearcbridge.gif \\"Azure Arc - Start/Stop VM\\")\\n\\n#### Resize Virtual Machines - CPU/Memory\\n\\n![Azure Arc - Resize VM](/uploads/resizevm-azurearcbridge.gif \\"Azure Arc - Resize VM\\")\\n\\n#### Resize Virtual Machines - Disk\\n\\n![Azure Arc - Resize Disk](/uploads/resizevmdisk-azurearcbridge.gif \\"Azure Arc - Resize Disk\\")\\n\\n### Troubleshooting\\n\\n* The \'resource-bridge-onboarding-script.ps1\' script contains an output file, named: arcvmware-output.log. This log file exists in the same directory as the script and is useful for investigating any errors.\\n* If you get no Folders, listed when the script prompts you to select a folder _(i.e. Please select folder)_:\\n\\n1. Right-click the Datacenter in vSphere\\n2. Select New Folder\\n3. Select New VM and Templates folder\\n4. Create a folder\\n\\n* If your Center becomes unavailable, it is most likely because you specified the same IP for the Azure Arc Appliance; if this is the case, log in to the host containing your Azure Arc Bridge and stop/delete the resources from the disk and remove from inventory. Then rerun deployment, this time selecting an appropriate IP."},{"id":"/2022/03/27/create-a-site-to-site-vpn-to-azure-with-a-ubiquiti-dream-machine-pro","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022/03/27/create-a-site-to-site-vpn-to-azure-with-a-ubiquiti-dream-machine-pro","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-27-create-a-site-to-site-vpn-to-azure-with-a-ubiquiti-dream-machine-pro.md","title":"Create a Site to Site VPN to Azure with a Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro","description":"The Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro has a lot of functionality built-in, including IPsec Site-to-site VPN(Virtual Private Network) support.","date":"2022-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":6.885,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"date":"2022-03-27 00:00:00 +1300","title":"Create a Site to Site VPN to Azure with a Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"images/iazure-marketplace-banner.png"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Azure Arc Bridge - Implementation and Testing","permalink":"/2022/04/20/azure-arc-bridge-implementing-and-testing"},"nextItem":{"title":"Azure Optimization Engine","permalink":"/2022/03/16/azure-optimisation-engine"}},"content":"The Ubiquiti [Dream Machine Pro](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-unifi-os-consoles/products/udm-pro \\"Dream Machine Pro\\") has a lot of functionality built-in, including IPsec Site-to-site VPN_(Virtual Private Network)_ support.\\n\\nI recently installed and configured a UDM-PRO at home, so now it\'s time to set up a site-to-vpn to my Microsoft Azure network.\\n\\nI will create Virtual Network and Gateway resources using Azure Bicep, but please skip ahead.\\n\\nMy address range is as follows _(so make sure you adjust to match your setup and IP ranges)_:\\n\\n| On-premises | Azure |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| 192.168.1.0/24 | 10.0.0.0/16 |\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\n* The latest [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-7.1.0?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) modules and [Azure Bicep/Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) for local editing\\n* An Azure subscription that you have at least contributor rights to\\n* Permissions to the UDM Pro to set up a new network connection\\n\\nI will be using PowerShell [splatting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_splatting?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Splatting\\") as it\'s easier to edit and display. You can easily take the scripts here to make them your own.\\n\\n#### Deploy - Azure Network and Virtual Network Gateway\\n\\nI will assume that you have both [Azure

Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"PowerShell - Azure\\") modules installed and the know-how to connect to Microsoft Azure.\\n\\nAzure Bicep deployments _(like ARM)_ have the following command: \'TemplateParameterObject\'. \'TemplateParameterObject\' allows Azure Bicep to accept parameters from PowerShell directly, which can be pretty powerful when used with a self-service portal or pipeline.\\n\\nI will first make an Azure Resource Group using PowerShell for my Azure Virtual Network, then use the New-AzResourceGroupDeployment cmdlet to deploy my Virtual Network and subnets from my bicep file.\\n\\nAlong with the Virtual Network, we will also create 2 other Azure resources needed for a Site to Site VPN, a [Local Network Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Tutorial: Create a site-to-site VPN connection in the

event.\\n\\nThis article, along with others of its kind _(Articles, Videos etc.),_ cover Azure Management topics such as Azure Monitor, Azure Cost Management, Azure Policy, Azure Security Principles or Azure Foundations!\\n\\nToday I will be covering the [Azure Optimization Engine](https://github.com/helderpinto/AzureOptimizationEngine \\"Azure Optimization Engine\\").\\n\\n![#AzureSpringClean - Azure Optimization Engine](/uploads/azurespringclean_2022_aoe.png \\"#AzureSpringClean - Azure Optimization Engine\\")\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\n> The Azure Optimization Engine _(AOE)_ is an extensible solution designed to generate optimization recommendations for your Azure environment, like a fully customizable Azure Advisor.\\n>\\n> The first custom recommendations use-case covered by this tool was augmenting Azure Advisor Cost recommendations, particularly Virtual Machine right-sizing, with a fit score based on VM _(Virtual Machine)_ metrics and properties.\\n\\nThe Azure Optimization Engine can\u2026\\n\\n* Enable new custom recommendation types\\n* Augment Azure Advisor recommendations with richer details that better drive action\\n* Add fit score to recommendations.\\n* Add historical perspective to recommendations _(the older the recommendation, the higher the chances to remediate it)_\\n* Drive continuous automated optimisation\\n\\nAzure Optimisation Engine combines multiple data sources to give you better data-driven decisions and recommendations, outside of that usually deployed by the inbuilt Azure Advisor, example use-cases and data sources can be seen below:\\n\\n* Azure Resource Graph _(Virtual Machine and Managed Disks properties)_\\n* Azure Monitor Logs _(Virtual Machine performance metrics)_\\n* Azure Consumption _(consumption/billing usage details events)_\\n* Extracts data periodically to build a recommendations history\\n* Joins and queries data in an analytics-optimised repository _(Log Analytics)_\\n* Virtual Machine performance metrics collected with Log Analytics agent\\n* Can leverage existing customer setup\\n* Requires only a few metrics collected with a frequency >= 60 seconds\\n\\n> Besides collecting **all Azure Advisor recommendations**, AOE includes other custom recommendations that you can tailor to your needs:\\n>\\n> * Cost\\n>   * Augmented Advisor Cost VM right-size recommendations, with fit score based on Virtual Machine guest OS metrics _(collected by Log Analytics agents)_ and Azure properties\\n>   * Underutilized VM Scale Sets\\n>   * Unattached disks\\n>   * Standard Load Balancers without backend pool\\n>   * Application Gateways without backend pool\\n>   * VMs deallocated since a long time ago (_forgotten VMs)_\\n>   * Orphaned Public IPs\\n> * High Availability\\n>   * Virtual Machine high availability _(availability zones count, availability set, managed disks, storage account distribution when using unmanaged disks)_\\n>   * VM Scale Set high availability _(availability zones count, managed disks)_\\n>   * Availability Sets structure _(fault/update domains count)_\\n> * Performance\\n>   * VM Scale Sets constrained by lack of compute resources\\n> * Security\\n>   * Service Principal credentials/certificates without expiration date\\n>   * NSG rules referring to empty or non-existing subnets\\n>   * NSG rules referring to orphan or removed NICs\\n>   * NSG rules referring to orphan or removed Public IPs\\n> * Operational Excellence\\n>   * Load Balancers without backend pool\\n>   * Service Principal credentials/certificates expired or about to expire\\n>   * Subscriptions close to the maximum limit of RBAC _(Role Based Access Control)_ assignments\\n>   * Management Groups close to the maximum limit of RBAC assignments\\n>   * Subscriptions close to the maximum limit of resource groups\\n>   * Subnets with low free IP space\\n>   * Subnets with too much IP space wasted\\n>   * Empty subnets\\n>   * Orphaned NICs\\n\\nFeel free to skip to the Workbook and PowerBI sections to look at some of the outs of box data and recommendations.\\n\\nThe Azure Optimisation Engine is battle-tested\\n\\n* Providing custom recommendations since Nov 2019\\n* Serving Azure customers worldwide\\n* From smaller 50-500 VMs customers to larger ones with more than 5K VMs\\n* Several customer-specific developments (custom collectors and recommendation algorithms)\\n* Flexibility options include _(multi-subscription and multi-tenant capability)_\\n* Based on cheap services _(Azure Automation, Storage, small SQL Database_)\\n\\nA few hours after setting up the engine, you will get access to a Power BI dashboard and Log Analytic Workbooks with all Azure optimisation opportunities, coming from both Azure Advisor and tailored recommendations included in the engine.\\n\\nThese recommendations are then updated every seven days.\\n\\n> It is worth noting that Azure Optimisation Engine is **NOT** an official **Microsoft Product,** and as such is under no offical support, it was created and maintened by: H\xe9lder Pinto, a Senior Customer Engineer for Microsoft and would like to take the opportunity to thank H\xe9lder the amazing work he is doing with this product on a continous basis, and giving me his blessing to write this article, on which he has already done an amazing job documenting on Github.\\n\\n#### Architecture\\n\\n![Azure Optimization Engine Architecture](/uploads/architecture.jpg \\"Azure Optimization Engine Architecture\\")\\n\\nAzure Optimization Engine runs on top of Azure Automation _(Runbooks for each data source)_ and Log Analytics. It is supplemented by a storage account to store JSON and Azure SQL database to help control ingestion _(last processed blob and lines processed)_.\\n\\n### Install\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\nTaken directly from the Git repository readme, the prerequisite for Azure Optimization Engine are:\\n\\n* A supported Azure subscription _(see the_ [_FAQs_](https://github.com/helderpinto/AzureOptimizationEngine#faq)_on Github)_\\n* [Azure Powershell 6.6.0+](hhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-7.5.0&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Install the Azure Az PowerShell module\\")_(Azure Bicep support is not currently available but is being worked on)_.\\n* [Microsoft.Graph.Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation?view=graph-powershell-beta&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\" Microsoft.Graph.Authentication \\") and [Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation?view=graph-powershell-beta&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement\\") PowerShell modules\\n* A user account with Owner permissions over the chosen subscription, so that the Automation Managed Identity is granted the required privileges over the subscription (Reader) and deployment resource group _(Contributor)_\\n* _(Optional)_ A user account with at least Privileged Role Administrator permissions over the Azure AD tenant, so that the Managed Identity is granted the required privileges over Azure AD _(Global Reader)_\\n\\nDuring deployment, you\'ll be asked several questions. It would be best if you planned for the following:\\n\\n* Whether you\'re going to reuse an existing Log Analytics Workspace or create a new one. **IMPORTANT**: you should ideally reuse a workspace where you have VMs onboarded and already sending performance metrics _(`Perf` table)_; otherwise, you will not fully leverage the augmented right-size recommendations capability. If this is not possible/desired for some reason, you can still manage to use multiple workspaces _(see_ [_Configuring Log Analytics workspaces_](https://github.com/helderpinto/AzureOptimizationEngine/blob/master/docs/configuring-workspaces.md)_)_.\\n* An Azure subscription to deploy the solution _(if you\'re reusing a Log Analytics workspace, you must deploy into the same subscription the workspace is in)._\\n* A unique name prefix for the Azure resources being created (if you have specific naming requirements, you can also choose resource names during deployment)\\n* Azure region\\n\\nIf the deployment fails for some reason, you can repeat it, as it is idempotent _(i.e. they can be applied multiple times without changing the result)_. The exact process is used to upgrade a previous deployment with the latest version. You have to keep the same deployment options, so make sure you document them.\\n\\nWe will now go through and install the prerequisites from scratch; as in this article, I will be deploying the Azure Optimization Engine from our local workstation.\\n\\nYou can also install from the [Azure Cloud Shell,](https://luke.geek.nz/azure/setup-azure-cloud-shell/ \\"Azure Cloud Shell\\")\\n\\n##### Install Azure PowerShell & Microsoft Graph modules\\n\\n1. Open Windows PowerShell\\n2. Type in:\\n\\n       Install-Module -Name Az,Microsoft.Graph.Authentication,Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force\\n\\n#### Install\\n\\nNow that we have the prerequisites installed! Let\'s set up Azure Optimization Engine!\\n\\n 1. In your favourite web browser, **navigate** to the [**AzureOptimizationEngine**](https://github.com/helderpinto/AzureOptimizationEngine \\"https://github.com/helderpinto/AzureOptimizationEngine\\") GitHub repository.\\n 2. Select **Code**, **Download Zip**\\n 3. ![Azure Optimization Engine - GitHub](/uploads/2022-03-12-09_23_49-helderpinto_azureoptimizationengine_-the-azure-optimization-engine-is-an-extensi.png \\"Azure Optimization Engine - GitHub\\")\\n 4. **Download** and **extract** the ZIP file to a location you can easily navigate to in PowerShell (_I have extracted it to C:\\\\\\\\temp\\\\\\\\AzureOptimizationEngine-master\\\\\\\\AzureOptimizationEngine-master)_\\n 5. Open PowerShell _(or Windows Terminal)_\\n 6. Because the scripts were downloaded from the internet, we will need to **Unblock** these so that we can run them, open PowerShell and run the **script** below _(changing your path to the path that the files were extracted)_\\n\\n        Get-ChildItem -r \'C:\\\\temp\\\\AzureOptimizationEngine-master\\\\AzureOptimizationEngine-master\' | Unblock-File\\n 7. Now that the script and associated files have been unblocked **change** the **directory** to the **location** of the Deploy-AzureOptimizationEngine.ps1 **file**.\\n 8. Run: **.\\\\\\\\Deploy-AzureOptimizationEngine.ps1**\\n 9. ![Windows Terminal -\\\\\\\\Deploy-AzureOptimizationEngine.ps1](/uploads/2022-03-12-09_48_40-plex.png \\"Windows Terminal -\\\\Deploy-AzureOptimizationEngine.ps1\\")\\n10. A browser window will then popup, **authenticate to Azure** _(connect to the Azure tenant that has access to the Azure subscription you wish to set up Azure Optimization Engine on)_.\\n11. Once authentication, you will need to **confirm** the Azure **subscription** to which you want to deploy Azure Optimization Engine.\\n12. ![Azure Optimization Engine - Select Subscription](/uploads/aoe-selectazsubscription.png \\"Azure Optimization Engine - Select Subscription\\")\\n13. Once your subscription is selected, it\'s time to **choose** a **naming prefix** for your resources _(if you choose Enter, you can manually name each resource); in_ my case, my prefix will be: _aoegeek._ Because Azure Optimization Engine will be creating resources that are globally available, make sure you select a prefix that suits your organisation/use-case as you may run into issues with the name already being used.\\n14. ![Azure Optimization Engine - Select Region](/uploads/aoe-selectazprefix.png \\"Azure Optimization Engine - Select Region\\")\\n15. If you have an **existing Log Analytics** workspace that your Virtual Machines and resources are connected to, you can specify \'Y\' here to select your existing resource; I am creating this from fresh so that I will choose **\'N.**\'\\n16. ![Azure Log Analytics](/uploads/aoe-selectazloganalyticworkspace.png \\"Azure Log Analytics\\")\\n17. The Azure Optimization **Engine will now check that the names and resources are available** to be deployed to your subscriptions and resources _(nothing is deployed during this stage - if there is an error, you can fix the issue and go back)_.\\n18. Once validation has passed, **select** the **region** that Azure Optimization will be deployed to; I will deploy to australiaeast, so I choose 1.\\n19. Azure Optimization Engine now **requires** the **SQL Admin** username; for the SQL server and database it will create, I will go with: sqladmin\\n20. ![Azure Optimization Engine - Region](/uploads/aoe-selectlocationsql.png \\"Azure Optimization Engine - Region\\")\\n21. Now enter the **password** for the **sqladmin** account and press Enter\\n22. Verify that everything is correct, then press **Y** to deploy Azure Optimization Engine!\\n23. ![Windows Terminal - Deploy Azure Optimization Engine](/uploads/deploy-azureoptimizationengine.gif \\"Windows Terminal - Deploy Azure Optimization Engine\\")\\n24. Deployment could take 10-25 minutes... _(mine took 22 minutes and 51 seconds)_\\n25. While leaving the PowerShell window open, log into the Azure Portal; you should now have a new Resource Group, and your resources will start getting created... you can click on Deployments _(under Settings navigation bar)_ in the Resource Group to review the deployment status.\\n26. ![Azure Portal - Deployments](/uploads/deploycheck-azureoptimizationengine.gif \\"Azure Portal - Deployments\\")\\n27. If you notice a failure, in the Deployment tab for: \'PolicyDeployment\' you can ignore this, as it may have failed if the SQL Server hasn\'t been provisioned yet; once it has been provisioned, you can navigate back to this failed deployment and click \'Redeploy\', to deploy a SQL Security Alert policy.\\n\\n_Note: The Azure SQL database will have the Public IP from the location the script was deployed from, allowed on the Azure SQL database; you may need to adjust this depending on your requirements._\\n\\n#### Configure\\n\\n##### Onboard Azure VMs to Log Analytics using Azure Policy and PowerShell\\n\\nNow that Azure Optimization has been installed, let\'s onboard our current and future Azure Virtual Machines to Azure Optimization Engine, using Azure Policy. This is required if you want to get Azure Advisor Virtual Machine right-size recommendations augmented with guest OS metrics. If you don\'t collect metrics from the Virtual Machines, you will still have a fully functional Optimisation Engine, with many recommendations, but the Advisor Virtual Machine right-size ones will be served as is.\\n\\n1. Open **PowerShell** and **login** to **Azure** using: Connect-AzAccount\\n2. **Connect to** your Azure **subscription** that contains the Virtual Machines you want to onboard to Log Analytics\\n3. Type:\\n\\n       # Register the resource provider if it\'s not already registered\\n       Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace \'Microsoft.PolicyInsights\'\\n4. The PowerShell script below will:\\n   * Copies the built-in Azure Policy definition of [Deploy - Configure Log Analytics extension to be enabled on Windows virtual machines](https://www.azadvertizer.net/azpolicyadvertizer/0868462e-646c-4fe3-9ced-a733534b6a2c.html?desc=compareJson&left=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azadvertizer.net%2Fazpolicyadvertizerjson%2F0868462e-646c-4fe3-9ced-a733534b6a2c_2.0.0.json&right=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azadvertizer.net%2Fazpolicyadvertizerjson%2F0868462e-646c-4fe3-9ced-a733534b6a2c_2.0.1.json \\" Azure Policy definition Deploy - Configure Log Analytics extension to be enabled on Windows virtual machines \\")\\n   * Create a User-Managed Identity\\n   * Assign: Log Analytics contributor rights to a subscription scope\\n   * Create a policy assignment, and assign it to the subscription\\n5.

Although I haven\'t tested it yet, the same script above can be modified to suit._\\n\\n##### Onboard Azure VMs to Log Analytics using the Azure Portal\\n\\nIf you do not want to onboard VMs with Policy, you can do it manually via the Azure Portal.\\n\\n1. Open **Azure Portal**\\n2. Navigate to [**Log Analytic Workspaces**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.OperationalInsights%2Fworkspaces \\"Log Analytic Workspaces\\")\\n3. **Click on** the Log Analytic **workspace** that was provisioned for Azure Optimization Engine\\n4. Navigate to **Virtual Machines** _(under Workspace Data Sources)_\\n5. Click on the Virtual Machine you want to link up to the Log Analytics workspace, and click **Connect -** this will trigger the Log Analytic extension and agent o be installed. Repeat for any further Virtual Machines.\\n6. ![Log Analytics - Connect VM](/uploads/aoe-2019vmgen1_connectla.png \\"Log Analytics - Connect VM\\")\\n\\n##### Setup Log Analytic Performance Counters\\n\\nNow that we have Virtual Machines reporting to our Log Analytic instance, it\'s time to make sure we are collecting as much data as we need to give suitable recommendations, luckily a script has already been included in the Azure Optimisation repository called \'_Setup-LogAnalyticsWorkspaces.ps1_\' to configure the performance counters.\\n\\n1. Open **PowerShell** _(or Windows Terminal)_\\n2. **Change** the **directory** to the **location** of the Setup-LogAnalyticsWorkspaces.ps1, in the root folder of the repository extracted earlier\\n3. Run the following PowerShell commands to download the required PowerShell Modules:\\n\\n       Install-Module -Name Az.ResourceGraph\\n       Install-Module -Name Az.OperationalInsights\\n4. Then run: .**\\\\\\\\Setup-LogAnalyticsWorkspaces.ps1**\\n5. The script will then go through all Log Analytic workspaces that you have access to and check for performance counters.\\n6. ![Windows PowerShell - \\\\\\\\Setup-LogAnalyticsWorkspaces.ps1](/uploads/deploycheck-loganalytics.gif \\"Windows PowerShell - \\\\Setup-LogAnalyticsWorkspaces.ps1\\")\\n7. If they are missing from the Log Analytics workspace, then you can run:\\n\\n       ./Setup-LogAnalyticsWorkspaces.ps1 -AutoFix\\n\\nor\\n\\n     #Fix specific workspaces configuration, using a custom counter collection frequency\\n    ./Setup-LogAnalyticsWorkspaces.ps1 -AutoFix -WorkspaceIds \\"d69e840a-2890-4451-b63c-bcfc5580b90f\\",\\"961550b2-2c4a-481a-9559-ddf53de4b455\\" -IntervalSeconds 30\\n\\n##### Setup Azure AD-based recommendations by granting permissions to Managed Identity.\\n\\nAzure Optimization Engine, has the ability to do recommendations based on Microsoft Entra ID roles and permissions, but in order to do that, the System Assigned Identity of the Azure Optimization Engine account needs to be given \'Global Reader\' rights. As part of the deployment, you may have gotten the following error:\\n\\n_Cannot bind argument to parameter \'DirectoryRoleId\' because it is an empty string._\\n\\n_Could not grant role. If you want Azure AD-based recommendations, please grant the Global Reader role manually to the aoegeek-auto managed identity or, for previous versions of AOE, to the Run As Account principal._\\n\\nWe are going to grant the Azure Automation account \'Global Reader\' rights manually in the Azure Portal.\\n\\n 1. Open **Azure Portal**\\n 2. Navigate to [**Automation Accounts**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Automation%2FAutomationAccounts \\"Automation Accounts\\")\\n 3. **Open** your Azure Optimisation Engine **automation account**\\n 4. Navigate down the navigation bar to the **Account Settings** section and select: **Identity**\\n 5. ![Azure Automation - Identity](/uploads/aoe-managedidentityazautomate.png \\"Azure Automation - Identity\\")\\n 6. **Copy** the **object ID**\\n 7. Now navigate to [**Microsoft Entra ID**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview \\"Microsoft Entra ID\\")\\n 8. Click on **Roles and Administrators**\\n 9. Search for: **Global Reader**\\n10. Select Global Reader and select **+ Add assignments**\\n11. Paste in the object ID earlier, and click **Ok** to grant Global Reader rights to the Azure Automation identity.\\n\\n##### Azure Automation - Runbooks & Automation\\n\\nThe wind that gives Azure Optimization Engine its lift is Azure Automation and Runbooks, at the time I deployed this - I had x1 Azure Automation account and 33 runbooks!\\n\\nLooking at the runbooks deployed, you can get a sense of what Azure Optimization Engine is doing...\\n\\n| NAME | TYPE |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| aoegeek-auto | Automation Account |\\n| Export-AADObjectsToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-AADObjectsToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-AdvisorRecommendationsToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-AdvisorRecommendationsToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ARGAppGatewayPropertiesToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ARGAppGatewayPropertiesToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ARGAvailabilitySetPropertiesToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ARGAvailabilitySetPropertiesToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ARGLoadBalancerPropertiesToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ARGLoadBalancerPropertiesToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ARGManagedDisksPropertiesToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ARGManagedDisksPropertiesToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ARGNICPropertiesToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ARGNICPropertiesToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ARGNSGPropertiesToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ARGNSGPropertiesToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ARGPublicIpPropertiesToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ARGPublicIpPropertiesToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ARGResourceContainersPropertiesToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ARGResourceContainersPropertiesToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ARGUnmanagedDisksPropertiesToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ARGUnmanagedDisksPropertiesToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ARGVirtualMachinesPropertiesToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ARGVirtualMachinesPropertiesToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ARGVMSSPropertiesToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ARGVMSSPropertiesToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ARGVNetPropertiesToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ARGVNetPropertiesToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-AzMonitorMetricsToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-AzMonitorMetricsToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-ConsumptionToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-ConsumptionToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Export-RBACAssignmentsToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Export-RBACAssignmentsToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Ingest-OptimizationCSVExportsToLogAnalytics (aoegeek-auto/Ingest-OptimizationCSVExportsToLogAnalytics) | Runbook |\\n| Ingest-RecommendationsToSQLServer (aoegeek-auto/Ingest-RecommendationsToSQLServer) | Runbook |\\n| Recommend-AADExpiringCredentialsToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Recommend-AADExpiringCredentialsToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Recommend-AdvisorAsIsToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Recommend-AdvisorAsIsToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Recommend-AdvisorCostAugmentedToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Recommend-AdvisorCostAugmentedToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Recommend-ARMOptimizationsToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Recommend-ARMOptimizationsToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Recommend-LongDeallocatedVmsToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Recommend-LongDeallocatedVmsToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Recommend-UnattachedDisksToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Recommend-UnattachedDisksToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Recommend-UnusedAppGWsToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Recommend-UnusedAppGWsToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Recommend-UnusedLoadBalancersToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Recommend-UnusedLoadBalancersToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Recommend-VMsHighAvailabilityToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Recommend-VMsHighAvailabilityToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Recommend-VMSSOptimizationsToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Recommend-VMSSOptimizationsToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Recommend-VNetOptimizationsToBlobStorage (aoegeek-auto/Recommend-VNetOptimizationsToBlobStorage) | Runbook |\\n| Remediate-AdvisorRightSizeFiltered (aoegeek-auto/Remediate-AdvisorRightSizeFiltered) | Runbook |\\n| Remediate-LongDeallocatedVMsFiltered (aoegeek-auto/Remediate-LongDeallocatedVMsFiltered) | Runbook |\\n| Remediate-UnattachedDisksFiltered (aoegeek-auto/Remediate-UnattachedDisksFiltered) | Runbook |\\n\\nA lot of the runbooks, such as the Log Analytics workspace ID, link up to Azure Automation variables, such as this period in Days to look back for Advisor recommendations, by default, this is \'7\' but you can change this variable to suit your organisation\'s needs.\\n\\n![Azure Automation - Runbooks & Automation](/uploads/aoe-variables.png \\"Azure Automation - Runbooks & Automation\\")\\n\\n##### Azure Automation - Schedules\\n\\nAlong with containing the variables and configurations used by the Runbooks, it also contains the schedules for the ingest of data into the storage account and SQL databases, most of these are Daily, but schedules such as ingesting from the Azure Advisor are weekly, by default these times are in UTC.\\n\\n![Azure Automation - Schedules](/uploads/aoe-schedules.png \\"Azure Automation - Schedules\\")\\n\\nWhen making changes to these schedules _(or moving the Runbooks to be run from a Hybrid worker)_, it is recommended to use the Reset-AutomationSchedules.ps1 script. These times need to be in UTC.\\n\\n![Terminal - Reset-AutomationSchedules.ps1](/uploads/update-automationschedules.gif \\"Terminal - Reset-AutomationSchedules.ps1\\")\\n\\n##### Azure Automation - Credentials\\n\\nWhen we set up the Azure SQL database earlier, as part of the Azure Optimisation setup, we configured the SQL Admin account and password, these credentials are stored and used by the Runbooks in the Azure Automation credential pane.\\n\\n![Azure Automation - Credentials](/uploads/aoe-credentials.png \\"Azure Automation - Credentials\\")\\n\\n### View Recommendations\\n\\nIt\'s worth noting, that because Azure Optimization Engine stores its data into Log Analytics and SQL, you can use languages such as KQL directly on the Log Analytics workspace to pull out any information you might need and develop integration into other toolsets.\\n\\n##### Workbooks\\n\\nThere are x3 Azure Log Analytics workbooks included in the Azure Optimization Engine, these are as follows:\\n\\n| NAME | TYPE |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Resources Inventory | Azure Workbook |\\n| Identities and Roles | Azure Workbook |\\n| Costs Growing | Azure Workbook |\\n\\nThey can be easily accessed in the Azure Portal.\\n\\n1.

An Azure Compute Gallery provides:\\n>\\n> * Global replication.\\n> * Versioning and grouping of resources for easier management.\\n> * Highly available resources with Zone Redundant Storage _(ZRS)_ accounts in regions that support Availability Zones. ZRS offers better resilience against zonal failures.\\n> * Premium storage support _(Premium_LRS)_.\\n> * Sharing across subscriptions, and even between Active Directory _(AD)_ tenants, using Azure RBAC.\\n> * Scaling your deployments with resource replicas in each region.\\n\\nWith images, Azure VM applications that support both Linux and Windows operating systems get these benefits.\\n\\n> While you can create an image of a VM with apps pre-installed, you would need to update your image each time you have application changes. Separating your application installation from your VM images means there\u2019s no need to publish a new image for every line of code change.\\n>\\n> Application packages provide benefits over other deployment and packaging methods:\\n>\\n> * Grouping and versioning of your packages\\n> * VM applications can be globally replicated to be closer to your infrastructure, so you don\u2019t need to use AzCopy or other storage copy mechanisms to copy the bits across Azure regions.\\n> * Sharing with other users through Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC)\\n> * Support for virtual machines, and both flexible and uniform scale sets\\n> * If you have Network Security Group (NSG) rules applied on your VM or scale set, downloading the packages from an internet repository might not be possible. And with storage accounts, downloading packages onto locked-down VMs would require setting up private links.\\n> * VM applications can be used with the [DeployIfNotExists](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/effects?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) policy.\\n\\nAzure VM Application packages _(stored in an Azure Storage account)_ uses multiple resources, as below:\\n\\n| Resource | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Azure compute gallery | A gallery is a repository for managing and sharing application packages. Users can share the gallery resource and all the child resources will be shared automatically. The gallery name must be unique per subscription. For example, you may have one gallery to store all your OS images and another gallery to store all your VM applications. |\\n| VM application | This is the\xa0definition of your VM application. This is a\xa0logical\xa0resource that stores the common metadata for all the versions under it. For example, you may have an application definition for Apache Tomcat and have multiple versions within it. |\\n| VM Application version | This is the deployable resource. You can globally replicate your VM application versions to target regions closer to your VM infrastructure. The VM Application Version must be replicated to a region before it may be deployed on a VM in that region. |\\n\\nThere is no extra charge for using VM Application Packages, but you will be charged for the following resources:\\n\\n* Storage costs of storing each package and any replicas.\\n* Network egress charges for replication of the first image version from the source region to the replicated regions. Subsequent replicas are handled within the region, so there are no additional charges.\\n\\nBefore we deploy our first VM application, there are a few things we need to be aware of:\\n\\n* VM Application requires an Azure Compute Gallery\\n* VM Application requires an Azure storage account to store your applications\\n* The VM Application gets downloaded to the VM using the name of the VM application _(not the actual name and Extension of your file in the storage account)_\\n* Currently, in order to retry a failed installation, you need to remove the application from the profile and add it back\\n* No more than five applications per Virtual Machine deployed at a time\\n* The maximum size of the application is 1 GB\\n* You can\'t have multiple versions of the same application installed on a Virtual Machine, and a newer version will supersede an older version either via an upgrade command or complete reinstall.\\n\\nIn this article, we are going to deploy the Datto Remote Management & Monitoring Agent to a Windows Server 2022 Virtual Machine; this agent is a simple executable that installs on a virtual machine and allows remote access and management of a virtual machine, without requiring any other form of connectivity _(Azure Bastion, RDP via Public IP, Site to Site VPN etc.)_ for an MSP _(Managed Service Provider)_ using the Datto toolset, the same concept can be applied to any application _(theoretically you can also use this to run PowerShell installs or chocolatey installs)_. \\n\\n> It\'s worth noting the VM Applications are currently in Public Preview, there is a good chance there will be changes in the way these operate and are configured when it becomes Generally Available.\\n\\n### Setup Azure VM Application Deployment\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\nIn order to use VM Applications, we need:\\n\\n* A storage account\\n* Azure Compute gallery\\n* VM application definition and version _(in my example: the Datto RMM agent)_\\n\\nFollowing the guide, we will run through the creation of everything from scratch; I am, however, assuming you already have the executable or application package and know the instructions to install/uninstall it - as each application is different. The Microsoft[VM Applications docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/vm-applications?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#exe-installer \\"VM Applications overview\\") give a few good examples for getting started with various applications.\\n\\n#### Setup Storage Account\\n\\nThe Storage account is where your application will be placed; it uses blobs; depending on the importance of your application deployments, you may want to go for geo-replication etc., but in this example, I will be going with a locally redundant, StorageV2 general-purpose account.\\n\\n 1. Open the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Click on **+ Create a Resource**\\n 3. Search for: **Storage account**, and **select** it\\n 4. Click [**Create**](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StorageAccount-ARM \\"Create a storage account\\")\\n 5. **Select** your **subscription**\\n 6. **Select** a **Resource Group** for your storage account, **or create** a new **one**\\n 7. **Enter** your storage account **name** _(this needs to be globally unique)_\\n 8. **Select** your **region** that your application will be in; although the application can be replicated to other regions, it\'s better to select your primary region here.\\n 9. **Select** the **performance** and **redundancy** to match your requirements and click **Next: Advanced**\\n10. ![Azure Portal - Create Storage Account](/uploads/create-a-storage-account-microsoft-azure.png)\\n11. You can **leave** most **settings** here as **default**, the application executable will need to be able to be accessed directly; make sure the **Minimum TLS** is at least **1.2**.\\n12. You don\'t need hierarchical namespace etc.; unselect \'_Allow cross-tenant replication\'_ unless this is a feature you use.\\n13. ![Azure Portal - Create Storage Account](/uploads/create-a-storage-account-advanced-microsoft-azure.png)\\n14. Click **Review + Create** to skip to the last blade; most defaults are fine, but if you want to adjust the blob retainment and soft delete settings, go to the Data Protection tab, set them, then review your Configuration and select **Create**.\\n15. Go back to your storage account and click **Configuration**\\n16. Make sure: Allow storage account key access is: **Enabled**; if it is not, select Enabled and click **Save**.\\n\\n#### Setup Azure Compute Gallery\\n\\nNow that we have the Storage account to store your application binaries, we now need an Azure Compute Gallery _(previously the Shared Image Gallery)_ to keep your application definition and version metadata.\\n\\n 1. Open the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Click on **+ Create a Resource**\\n 3. Search for: **Azure Compute Gallery** and **select** it\\n 4. Click [**Create**](https://portal.azure.com/#create/microsoft.sharedImageGallery \\"Create Azure compute gallery\\")\\n 5. **Select** your **subscription** and **resource group** _(in this case, I am going to use the same resource group as the Storage account I created earlier)_\\n 6. Type in a **name**, and **select** your **region**\\n 7. Although not mandatory, use the opportunity to fill in a description for the purpose of the Compute Gallery for future reference\\n 8. ![Azure Portal - Create Storage Account](/uploads/create-azure-compute-gallery-microsoft-azure.png)\\n 9. Select **Review + Create**\\n10. Verify everything is correct and click on: **Create**\\n\\n#### Create Application Definition\\n\\nVM application definitions are created within a gallery and carry information about the application and requirements for using it internally. This includes the operating system type for the VM application versions contained within the application definition. The name of your Application definition defines the name of the file that will be downloaded to your virtual machines.\\n\\n 1. Open the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Navigate to \'**All Resources\'**\\n 3. **Find and click on** your **Azure Compute Gallery** you created earlier\\n 4. On the overview pane, select **+ Add**\\n 5. Click on +**VM application definition**\\n 6. Your subscription and resource group should be automatically selected to the location of the Compute Gallery, type in the **name of** your **applicatio.n**\\n 7. Select your **region**\\n 8. Select the **OS type** - in my case, and I select **Windows**\\n 9. ![Azure Portal - Create Application Definition](/uploads/create-a-vm-application-definition-microsoft-azure.png)\\n10. Click **Next: Publishing Options**\\n11. The following fields are not mandatory, but I recommend filling in areas to help report on and manage your applications.\\n    * Description\\n    * End of life date\\n    * Eula link\\n    * Privacy URI\\n    * Release notes URI\\n12. ![Azure Portal - Create Metadata](/uploads/create-a-vm-application-definition-metadata-microsoft-azure.png)\\n13. Click **Review + create**\\n14. Verify your Configuration and select **Create**\\n\\n#### Create Application version\\n\\nNow that we have the application definition setup, it\'s time to set up the version and upload our binary file.+\\n\\n 1. Open the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Navigate to \'**All Resources\'**\\n 3. **Find and click on** your **Azure Compute Gallery** you created earlier\\n 4. Click on **Definitions**_(besides the Get Started link)_\\n 5. **Select** your Application **definition**\\n 6. Click on: **+Add** \\n 7. **Enter** in your **version number**, and this will increment and grow as you adjust and troubleshoot your application; I recommend starting with 0.0.1 then working your way up, with 1.0.0 being potentially your final/production-ready releast.\\n 8. Select your **Region**\\n 9. Now we need to select our source application package _(you can enter in your blob URL if you know it)_; we haven\'t uploaded it to our storage account yet, so we will select **Browse**\\n10. **Select** your **Storage account**\\n11. Press **+ Container**\\n12. **Enter** in the **name** of your **container** _( it has to be in lowercase)_, such as the application name _(to keep things separate, consider a container per application)_\\n13. Press **Upload**\\n14. **Browse** to your **file** and select it\\n15. Expand **Advanced**\\n16. Make sure that Blob type is: **Blob**\\n17. ![Azure Portal - Azure Blob](/uploads/upload-blob-microsoft-azure.png)\\n18. Click **Upload**\\n19. **Select** your newly uploaded file and click **Select**\\n20. _Note: You can only upload one file as part of your package, you can upload a ZIP file and have your Install script extract it_\\n21. The **Install script** is the command to install to your application, by default windows applications are set to install cmd. This already knows the directory your files are in because the file will be uploaded as the application name (i.e. DattoRMM), it needs to be renamed to include .exe and then ran, I will switch to PowerShell for the Install script, so will enter:\\n\\n        powershell.exe -command \\"Rename-Item \'.\\\\DattoRMM\' -NewName \'DattoRMM.exe\'; Start-Process \'.\\\\DattoRMM.exe\'\\"\\n22. If you have a script to uninstall the application, enter it _(in my case, I am just going to put a \'.\' to skip this, as I don\'t currently have an uninstall script developed)_\\n23. The rest of the Configuration isn\'t mandatory; the Update script is used by Azure when a new version of an application is created; by default, the Azure VM extension will treat an upgrade like a completely new install and run the install steps unless an update script is defined.\\n24. ![Azure Portal - Application Version](/uploads/create-a-vm-application-version-microsoft-azure.png)\\n25. Click **Next: Replication**\\n26. Like Azure Compute Images, you can replicate your Azure VM applications across multiple regions _(depending on where your workloads are)_, such as Australia East to West Europe, and store it then Zone Redundant or Local storage. In my example, I am going to leave mine as one replica in Australia East on locally-redundant storage and click **Review + create**\\n27. Verify everything looks ok and click **Create** to create your application version! This may take a few minutes to create, depending on your configuration and replication.\\n\\n### Deploy Azure VM Application\\n\\n#### Deploy Azure VM Application to Virtual Machines using the Azure Portal\\n\\nNow that your Azure VM Application has been created, it is now time to deploy to a Virtual Machine. I have a Windows Server 2022 Datacenter Azure Gen 2 VM running as a Standard_B2ms as my test machine, and because I am going to use the Datto RMM agent to connect to the machine, I don\'t need any RDP ports open etc.\\n\\n 1. Open the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Microsoft Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Navigate to **Virtual Machines**\\n 3. Click on your Virtual Machine\\n 4. Under Settings, click **Extensions + Applications**\\n 5. Click **VM Applications**\\n 6. Click **+ Add application**\\n 7. **Select** your **application** _(note you can select a particular version, by default, it is the latest)_\\n 8. Click **Ok**\\n 9. ![Azure Portal - VM-P01](/uploads/vm-p01-microsoft-azure.png)\\n10. You can select your Install Order _(i.e. if you had multiple applications, you can select which one installs 1st, 2nd, third and so on)_; I will select No Reference and click Save to start the deployment.\\n11. If you click Extensions, you should see that a: VMAppExtension has started to be installed; click on Refresh to update the status and click on the Extension to a more detailed status message, hopefully you see \\":Operational Install is SUCCESS\\"\\n12. My Virtual Machine has now had the Datto Remote Management agent installed successfully and has appeared in the portal for me to connect to!\\n13. ![Azure - Datto RMM](/uploads/vm-p01-datto-rmm.png)\\n\\n#### Deploy Azure VM Application to Multiple Virtual Machines using PowerShell\\n\\nI\'ve created the PowerShell script below to deploy an application to multiple Virtual Machines at once, it can easily be adjusted for a PowerShell Runbook that runs periodically to install software on machines it may be missing.

If you want to make use of the rest of the Cloud Defender offerings (and you should), then make sure you install the Log Analytics agent; however, you don\'t need it for Just In Time Access.\\n 8. **Navigate** back to your **Virtual Machine**\\n 9. Click on **Configuration**\\n10. Now you should see: **Enable for Just-in-Time VM access**; select this to **enable** Just in Time.\\n\\nNow, if you go to the Network Security Group attached to the network interface of the VM, you should see a Deny Rule for 3389 that\'s been created with a priority lower than the allowed rules, forcing the block.\\n\\n![Azure Portal](/uploads/azureportal-justintime_nsgblock.png)\\n\\n### Configure Just In Time\\n\\nNow that we have enabled Defender for Cloud, it\'s time to configure what ports (can be used for more than just RDP and SSH access) and the length of time that access is allowed. \\n\\n 1. Click on **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**\\n 2. Select **Workload Protections**\\n 3. Select **Just-In-Time VM access**\\n 4. ![Azure Portal - Defender for Cloud](/uploads/azureportal-defenderforcloud.png)\\n 5. **Select** the **VM** you have configured.\\n 6. Click the **ellipsis** on the right-hand side\\n 7. Select **Edit**\\n 8. Azure has automatically added the port for RDP (3389) and sets a maximum 3 hour request time (that I am allowed to connect to the VM); I can also restrict Just In TIme access from specific IP addresses, and IP ranges to avoid anyone being able to RDP from their home IP.\\n 9. ![Azure Portal - Defender for Cloud](/uploads/azureportal-configurationports.png)\\n10. **Make any adjustments** you feel suits your environment.

You can reuse your security policy at scale without manual maintenance of explicit IP addresses.\\n\\nThese Azure Application Security groups allow you to define your workloads, for example, Azure Virtual Desktop Session Hosts as a \'group\' and what they may have access to in your Azure Virtual Network without opening up the service to everything inside of that VNET or creating overly complex rules that could make it hard to troubleshoot.\\n\\nThere are a few things to be mindful of:\\n\\n* Azure Application Security Groups are Virtual Network-specific, so they can work to allow resources across subnets, but not in separate Virtual Networks, even if they have peered.\\n* As with most Azure resources, there are Subscription level[limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits?toc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-network%2Ftoc.json&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits \\"Networking limits - Azure Resource Manager\\"); you cannot have more than 3,000 Azure Application Security groups in a single subscription and region.\\n* The rules that specify an application security group as the source or destination are only applied to the network interfaces that are members of the application security group; this does not affect anything not in this group, even though your Network Security Group is based on the subnet.\\n* You can assign more than one Application Security group to a resource\\n\\nIn my example, I have a single virtual network, with 2 subnets _(one subnet, has an Azure Virtual Desktop session host and the other one has a webserver running IIS)_, using Azure Application Security Groups, we will restrict IIS access to the webserver from the Azure Virtual Session hosts only - so IIS won\'t be accessible from any other machine in the Virtual Network.\\n\\n![High Level  - Diagram ASG](/uploads/highleveldiagram_asg.png \\"High Level  - Diagram ASG\\")\\n\\n#### Create Application Security Group\\n\\nLet\'s get started by creating an Application Security Group.\\n\\n1.

We will set up a Point to Site VPN using Windows 11.\\n\\n![Azure Point to Site](/uploads/hl_azurep2s.png)\\n\\nDepending on the SKU of your Virtual Network Gateway, depends on the number of concurrent connections and throughput you are allowed; because we are using Microsoft Entra ID and the OpenVPN protocol, I will be selecting Generation 1, VpnGw1, supporting a max of 250 connections _(you can double the number of throughput and connections if you are running in Active/Active and have a second gateway, or select a higher SKU)_.\\n\\n> Azure AD authentication is supported for OpenVPN\xae protocol connections only and requires the Azure VPN client.\\n\\nA note about Gateway SKUs _(apart from Basic)_ you can resize in the same generation _(i.e. Generation 1 VpnGw1 to VpnGw3, but you can\'t go from Generation 1 VpnGw1 to Generation 2 VpnGw5, in order to upgrade, you have to delete and recreate the Gateway, just keep this in mind when deciding on the SKU of your resources_).\\n\\nYou can read more about the Virtual Network Gateways and VPN SKUs at the official Microsoft documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796); your Gateway SKU may differ depending on your requirements.\\n\\n### Create Azure Point to Site VPN using Microsoft Entra ID authentication\\n\\n#### Prerequisites\\n\\n* An Azure subscription _(that you have at least contributor rights to and the ability to create Users and Groups)_\\n* An endpoint device running Windows 10 or 11 that you can install the [Azure VPN client](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/azure-vpn-client-preview/9np355qt2sqb?rtc=2&activetab=pivot:overviewtab \\" Azure VPN Client\\") onto\\n\\n#### Create Virtual Network\\n\\nFirst things first, let\'s create a Virtual Network.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Click on **+ Create a resource**\\n 3. Search for: **Virtual Network** and click on it\\n 4. Click **Create**\\n 5. **Select** or create your **Resource Group** that you want your network resource to sit in _(I recommend Virtual Network and the gateway resources sit in its own Resource Group away from other resources so that they can be protected by resource locks, RBAC and they are usually classified as a shared resource)_.\\n 6. ![Azure Virtual Network](/uploads/azureportal-createvirtualnetwork.png \\"Azure Virtual Network\\")\\n 7. Click **Next: IP Addresses**\\n 8. Now we need to **define** the **Address space** and subnets; I will leave the Address space as 10.0.0.0/16 but remove the Default subnet _(select the checkbox next to the Subnet and select Delete)_\\n 9. Click +**Add Subnet**, and add a new subnet with the name of GatewaySubnet with an IP range of: 10.0.1.0/27 _(this Subnet will be used by our Virtual Network Gateway, and the name needs to be exactly GatewaySubnet)_.\\n10. Now I will add a subnet named: app servers, for the Virtual Machines I will need to connect to will be placed.\\n11. ![Azure Virtual Network](/uploads/azureportal-createvirtualnetworksubnets.png \\"Azure Virtual Network\\")\\n12. Click **Next: Security**\\n13. Leave everything _(BastionHost, DDoS Protection Standard, Firewall)_ as Disabled.\\n14. Click **Next: Tags**\\n15. Enter in any tags and click **Review + Create**\\n16. Review your configuration and click **Create**\\n\\n#### Create Virtual Network Gateway\\n\\nNow that we have the foundation of our setup - an Azure Virtual Network, it is time to provision the Gateway itself; just a note before we continue, the Gateway can take 30-60 minutes to provision.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Click on **+ Create a resource**\\n 3. Type in and search for: **Virtual Network Gateway**\\n 4. Click **Create**\\n 5. Type in the **name** of your Azure Virtual Network **Gateway**\\n 6. Select the **region** _(it must be the same region as your virtual network)_\\n 7. Select the Gateway Type: **VPN**\\n 8. The VPN type is: **Route-based**\\n 9. **Select** the **SKU**, in this example - I will be going with VpnGw1\\n10. **Select** the **Generation** of the Virtual Network Gateway; I am going with: Generation 1\\n11. **Select** the **Virtual Network** that you created earlier, and it will automatically find and assign the Gateway to the Subnet named: GatewaySubnet\\n12. **Select** Standard **public IP** address **SKU**\\n13. **Select Public IP** address and select: **Create new**\\n14. **Type** in your public IP **name**\\n15. **Leave** \'Enable active-active mode\' and \'Configure BGP\' as **Disabled**.\\n16. Click **Review + Create**\\n17. ![Azure Virtual Network Gateway](/uploads/azureportal-createvnetfgw.png \\"Azure Virtual Network Gateway\\")\\n18. **Verify configuration** is correct and clicks **Create**\\n19. It can take up to 30-60 minutes for the Virtual Network Gateway to be created.\\n\\n#### Setup Microsoft Entra ID authentication on the Virtual Network Gateway\\n\\nNow that the Virtual Network has been created, we can now set up Microsoft Entra ID authentication.\\n\\n##### Collect Microsoft Entra ID Tenant ID\\n\\nFirst, we need to collect the Azure AD Tenancy ID\\n\\n1. Log in to the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Azure Portal\\")\\n2. Click on **Microsoft Entra ID**\\n3. In the Overview pane, **copy** the **Tenant ID** and save this for the next step.\\n\\n##### Grant Azure VPN Client permisisons\\n\\nNow we need to grant the Azure VPN application permissions.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. Open a new window and type in and press Enter:\\n\\n        https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=41b23e61-6c1e-4545-b367-cd054e0ed4b4&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https://portal.azure.com&nonce=1234&prompt=admin_consent\\n 3. If you get an error about external identity, then replace /**common**/ with your tenant ID.\\n 4. ![Azure VPN Permissions](/uploads/azureportal_azurevpnpermissions.png \\"Azure VPN Permissions\\")\\n 5. Click **Accept**\\n 6. Navigate back to **Microsoft Entra ID**\\n 7. Select **Enterprise Applications**\\n 8. Select **Azure VPN**\\n 9. **Copy** the **Application ID** of the Azure VPN enterprise application _(you will need both Application ID and tenant ID for the next steps)_\\n10. ![Azure VPN](/uploads/azurevpn_enterpriseappvpn.png \\"Azure VPN\\")\\n\\n##### Configure Point to Site Connection\\n\\nNow its time to configure the Virtual Network Gateway\\n\\n 1. Log in to the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. **Navigate** to the Virtual Network **Gateway** you created earlier\\n 3. Click on **Point-to-site configuration**\\n 4. Click **Configure now**\\n 5. Enter in your **address pool** _(this is the address pool of the VPN clients, make sure this doesn\'t overlap with any other IP range you use, I will go with: 172.0.0.0/16)_\\n 6. Make sure the Tunnel type is: **OpenVPN (SSL)**\\n 7. Select **Microsoft Entra ID** for the **Authentication** type\\n 8. For **Tenant, ID enter** in: https://login.microsoftonline.com/**TENANTID**/ and enter in your own Tenant ID.\\n 9. For the Audience (this is the users and groups that are assigned to the Enterprise Azure VPN application), put in the Application ID of the Azure VPN.\\n10. For the Issuer, enter in: https://sts.windows.net/**TENANTID**/\\n11. ![Azure Virtual Network Gateway](/uploads/azure-point-to-site-configuration.png \\"Azure Virtual Network Gateway\\")\\n12. Click **Save**\\n13. It may take 1-5 minutes to save the configuration\\n\\n##### Install and connect using the Azure VPN client\\n\\nNow that the Point to Site VPN has been configured it\'s time to connect!\\n\\n 1. Click on **Download VPN client** _(if it is greyed out, then navigate to the Overview pane, then back to the Point-to-site configuration)_.\\n 2. Extract the zip file, you will need these files\\n 3. **Download** the [Azure VPN Client](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2117554) to your computer.\\n 4. ![Azure VPN Client](/uploads/windowsstore-azurevpn.png \\"Azure VPN Client\\")\\n 5. Once, downloaded click **Open.**\\n 6. Click the **+** sign (lower left)\\n 7. Click **Import**\\n 8. **Navigate** to the: **azurevpnconfig.xml** file that you downloaded earlier and click **Open**\\n 9. You can change the Connection Name to something more user friendly _(you can also edit the file directly for when you look at pushing out this to multiple users, but make sure you have a backup of the file)_\\n10. Click **Save**\\n11. ![Azure VPN Connection](/uploads/azurevpnclient-beforeconnection.png \\"Azure VPN Connection\\")\\n12. Click **Connect**\\n13. Enter in your Microsoft Entra ID credentials _(you may be prompted for MFA, depending on the rules - you can use Azure VPN application under conditional access)_\\n14. ![Azure VPN Connection](/uploads/azurevpnclient-afterconnection.png \\"Azure VPN Connection\\")\\n15. **You should now be connected to the Azure network through a point to site VPN!**\\n16. If I run \'ipconfig /all\' on my device, I can see a PPP adapter that is connected and on the VPN address range created earlier: 172.0.0.2\\n17. ![Azure Point to Site Connections](/uploads/azurevpn-ipconfig.png \\"Azure Point to Site Connections\\")\\n18. If I navigate back to the Point-to-site connection in the Azure Portal, I can see, my connection has been allocated:\\n19. ![Azure Point to Site Connections](/uploads/azurevpn-p2sconnections.png \\"Azure Point to Site Connections\\")\\n20. I can now use Remote Desktop to connect to a Virtual Machine, running in my AppServers Subnet, which I am running without the need of a Public IP or bastion/jump host:\\n21. ![Azure Point to Site VPN](/uploads/azurevpn-rdp.png \\"Azure Point to Site VPN\\")\\n\\nNote: I don\'t have a DNS service running in Azure, but the Azure VPN agent will take DNS from the Virtual Network if you have this configured to point towards a DNS server (Active Directory, or other DNS forwarder (pointing towards Azure DNS IP: 168.63.129.16) such as Azure Firewall DNS proxy; you can set Custom DNS servers by modifying your DNS configuration, or add entries into the host file of the computers.\\n\\nYou can set your Custom DNS settings (remember to add the DNS suffix if needed) and configure the VPN to automatically connect by following the details on the [OpenVPN Azure AD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/openvpn-azure-ad-client#faq \\"Microsoft Entra ID authentication: Configure a VPN client for P2S OpenVPN protocol connections\\") Client page.\\n\\nUsing Intune, you can also push this configuration to your Windows 10 and 11 clients\\n\\n* [Create custom Intune profiles to deploy VPN client profiles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-profile-intune?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)"},{"id":"/2022/01/08/my-website","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022/01/08/my-website","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-08-my-website.md","title":"My Website Setup","description":"Pretty simple article today regarding \'My website setup\'.","date":"2022-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Misc","permalink":"/tags/misc"}],"readingTime":1.79,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"date":"2022-01-08 00:00:00 +1300","title":"My Website Setup","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Misc"],"toc":false,"header":{"teaser":"images/cover.jpg"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Create Azure Point to Site VPN using Microsoft Entra ID authentication","permalink":"/azure/create-azure-point-to-site-vpn-using-azure-active-directory-authentication"},"nextItem":{"title":"Azure Public DNS as Code","permalink":"/azure/azure-public-dns-as-code"}},"content":"Pretty simple article today regarding \'My website setup\'.\\n\\nI\'ve had a few people ask what CMS _(Content Management System)_ my website runs on - and no it\'s not running on an Azure App Service!  \\n  \\nI am using:  \\n\\n* Github Pages (running Jekyll and Ruby on Rails)  \\n* Cloudflare as my DNS CDN (which also allows me to set HTTPS) and cache the website across the planet  \\n  \\nBecause the pages are in a git repository, I have version control across my pages, can roll back or make any changes easily and allow others to submit pull requests for changes, or issues natively.  \\n  \\nThe pages are created using Markdown, I usually have a OneNote page with an idea or blurb, then Forestry to do the initial post, and then manually edit the files and verify the syntax is correct, add tables into the page and fix any issues that may have been caused (Forestry doesn\'t support markdown tables and can make some content look a bit weird and unstructured, but its usually an easy fix editing the markdown manually).  \\n  \\nHaving it on Github pages, helped me learn a lot more about using git and source control, versioning methodologies.  \\n  \\nThen for comments, I use Disqus and for analytics, Google Analytics and Bing Webmaster Tools.  \\n  \\n* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/ \\"https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/\\")\\n* [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/ \\"https://pages.github.com/\\")\\n* [What CMS is this site using?](https://whatcms.org/?s=luke.geek.nz \\"https://whatcms.org/?s=luke.geek.nz\\")\\n* [https://forestry.io/](https://forestry.io/ \\"https://forestry.io/\\")\\n* [https://disqus.com/](https://disqus.com/ \\"https://disqus.com/\\")  \\n  \\nAll in all - I just have to pay for the domain, everything else is free and because it\'s stateless, caching content is a lot easier and I don\'t have to worry about keeping a CMS up to date/patched or a database tuned!  \\n  \\nIf you\'re wondering why it\'s not running on an Azure App Service?

I have access to an Azure DevOps _(free)_ subscription and a custom domain I joined named \'badasscloud.com\'.\\n\\nI will assume that you have nothing set up but feel free to skip the sections that aren\'t relevant.\\n\\nThat that we have the prerequisites sorted let\'s set it up...\\n\\n#### Create Azure DevOps Repository\\n\\n 1. [**Sign in to Azure DevOps**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2014676&githubsi=true&clcid=0x409&WebUserId=e3e298aac5104b0e8e949b3b5bbeb314)\\n 2. Select **+ New Project**\\n 3. Give your **project** a **name** _(i.e., I am going with: DNSAsCode)_\\n 4. ![Azure DevOps - Create New Project](/uploads/azuredevops-creatednsproject.png \\"Azure DevOps - Create New Project\\")\\n 5. Click **Create** _(your project will now be created)_\\n 6. Click on **Repos**\\n 7. Click on **Files**\\n 8. Find the \'**Initialize Main branch with a README or gitignore**\' section and click **Initialize.**\\n 9. ![Azure DevOps - Create New Project](/uploads/azuredevops-initializerepo.png \\"Azure DevOps - Create New Project\\")\\n10. You should now have an empty git repository!\\n\\n    #### Create Azure DevOps Service Connection\\n\\n    For Azure DevOps to connect to Microsoft Azure, we need to set up a service principal; you can create the service connection in Azure DevOps. However, it usually generates a service principal with a name that could be unrecognizable in the future in Azure, and I prefer to develop them according to naming convention and something that I can look at and instantly recognize its use-case. To do that, we will create it using Azure CLI.\\n     1. Open **PowerShell**\\n     2. **Run** the following **commands** to connect to Azure and **create** your **Service Principal** with Contributor **access** to **Azure**:\\n\\n            #Connects to Microsoft Azure\\n            az.cmd login\\n            #Set SPN name\\n            $AppRegName = \'SPN.AzureSubscription.Contributor\'\\n            #Creates SPN and sets SPN as Contributor to the subscription\\n            $spn = az.cmd ad sp create-for-rbac --name $AppRegName --role \'contributor\'\\n            #Exports Password, Tenant & App ID for better readability - required for Azure DevOps setup\\n            $spn | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -Property password, tenant, appId\\n            az.cmd account show --query id --output tsv\\n            az.cmd account show --query name --output tsv\\n     3. Make sure you **record** the **password**, **application ID** and the **subscription ID/name**; you will need this for the next step - you won\'t be able to view it anywhere else; if you lose it, you can rerun the sp create command to generate a new password. Now that we have the SPN, we need to add the details into Azure DevOps.\\n     4. [**Sign in to Azure DevOps**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2014676&githubsi=true&clcid=0x409&WebUserId=e3e298aac5104b0e8e949b3b5bbeb314)\\n     5. Navigate to the DNS As Code **project** you created earlier\\n     6. Click on **Project Setting**s _(bottom right-hand side of the window)_\\n     7. Click on **Service connections**\\n     8. Click on: **Create a service connection**\\n     9. Select **Azure Resource Manager**\\n    10. Click **Next**\\n    11. Click on: **Service Principal (Manual**) and click Next\\n    12. **Enter** in the following **details** that we exported earlier from the creation of the service principal:\\n        * Subscription ID\\n        * Subscription Name\\n        * Service Principal ID _(the appId)_\\n        * Service principal key _(password)_\\n        * Tenant ID\\n    13. Click **Verify** to verify that Azure DevOps can connect to Azure; you should hopefully see a Verification succeeded.\\n    14. Give the **Service** connection a **name** _(this is the display name that is visual in Azure DevOps)_\\n    15. **Add** a **description** _(i.e. created by, created on, created for)_\\n    16. Click on **Verify and save**\\n    17.

In other words, it\u2019s a software testing method focusing on finding evidence of problems before they are experienced by users.\\n>\\n> Chaos engineering is a methodology that helps developers attain consistent reliability by hardening services against failures in production. Another way to think about chaos engineering is that it\'s about embracing the inherent chaos in complex systems and, through experimentation, growing confidence in your solution\'s ability to handle it.\\n>\\n> A common way to introduce chaos is to deliberately inject faults that cause system components to fail. The goal is to observe, monitor, respond to, and improve your system\'s reliability under adverse circumstances. For example, taking dependencies offline (stopping API apps, shutting down VMs, etc.), restricting access (enabling firewall rules, changing connection strings, etc.), or forcing failover (database level, Front Door, etc.), is a good way to validate that the application is able to handle faults gracefully.\\n\\nIntroducing controlled Chaos tools such as Chaos Monkey and now \u2013 [Azure Chaos Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/chaos-studio/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) allows you to put pressure and, in some cases, take down your services to teach you how your services will react under strain and identity areas of improvement as resiliency and scalability to improve your systems.\\n\\n![Chaos](/images/chaosengineering-banner.png \\"Chaos\\")\\n\\nAzure Chaos Studio _(currently in Preview and only supported in several_ [_regions_](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=chaos-studio&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)_now)_ is an enabler for \'controlled Chaos\' in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. Using that same tool that Microsoft uses to test and improve their services \u2013 you can as well!\\n\\nChaos Studio works by creating Experiments _(i.e., Faults/Capabilities)_ that run against Targets _(your resources, whether they are agent or service-based)_.\\n\\nThere are two types of methods you can use to target your resources:\\n\\n* Service-direct\\n* Agent-based\\n\\nService-direct is tied into the Azure fabric and puts pressure on your resources from outside them _(i.e., supported on most resources that don\'t need agent-based, PaaS resources, such as Network Security Groups)._ For example, a service-direct capability may be to add or remove a security rule from your network security group for faulty findings.\\n\\nAgent-based relies on an agent installed; these are targeted at resources such as Virtual Machine and Virtual Machine scale sets; agent-based targets use a user-assigned managed identity to manage an agent on your virtual machines and wreak havoc by running capabilities such as stopping services and putting memory and disk pressure on your workloads.\\n\\nJust a word of warning, before you proceed to allow Chaos to reign in your environment, make sure it is done out of hours or, better yet \u2013 against development or test resources, also make sure that any resources that support autoscaling are disabled \u2013 or you might suddenly find ten more instances of that resource you were running _(unless of course you\'re testing that autoscaling is working)_! \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\nIn my test setup, I have the following already pre-created that I will be running my experiments against:\\n\\n* Virtual Machine Scale set _(running Windows with two instances)_\\n* Single Virtual Machine _(running Windows)_ to test shutdown against\\n\\nThe currently supported resource types of Azure Chaos Studio can be found \'[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/chaos-studio-fault-providers?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\'.\\n\\n### Setup Azure Chaos Studio\\n\\n#### Create Managed Identity\\n\\nBecause we will use Agent-based capabilities to generate our Faults, I needed to create a Managed Identity to give Chaos Studio the ability to wreak havoc on my resources!\\n\\n 1.

On the left band side Blade, select **Experiments**\\n 3. Click **+ Create**\\n 4. **Select** your **Subscription**\\n 5. **Select** your **Resource Group** to save the Experiment into\\n 6. **Type** in a **name** for your **Experiment** that makes sense; in this case, we will put some Memory pressure on the VM scale set.\\n 7. **Select** your **Region**\\n 8. Click **Next: Experiment Designer**\\n 9. **Using** Experiment **Designer**, you can **design** your **Faults**; you can have multiple capabilities hit a resource with expected delays, _i.e., you can have Memory pressure on a VM for 10 minutes, then CPU pressure, then shutdown._\\n10. We are going to select **Add Action**\\n11. Then **Add Fault**\\n12. I am going to select **Physical Memory** pressure\\n13. Leave the duration to **10 minutes**\\n14. Because this will go against my VM scale set, I will add in the instances I want to target _(if you aren\'t targeting a VM Scale set, you can leave this blank, you can find the instance ID by going to your VM Scale set click on Instances, click on the VM instance you want to target and you should see the Instance ID in the Overview pane)_\\n15. ![Azure Chaos Studio - Add fault](/uploads/azure_chaosstudio_createexperimentaddfault.png \\"Azure Chaos Studio - Add fault\\")\\n16. Select **Next: Target resources**\\n17. **Select** your **resources** _(you will notice as this is an Agent-based capability, only agent supported resources are listed)_\\n18. Select **Add**\\n19. I am then going to **Add delay for 5 Minutes**\\n20. Then add an **abrupt VM shutdown** for 10 minutes _(Chaos Studio will automatically restart the VM after the 10-minute duration)_.\\n21. ![Azure Chaos Studio create experiment](/uploads/azure_chaosstudio_createexperimentaddfault2.png \\"Azure Chaos Studio create experiment\\")\\n22. As you can see with the Branches _(items that will run in parallel)_ and actions, you can have multiple faults running at once in parallel by using branches or one after the other sequentially.\\n23. Now that we are ready with our faulty, we are going to click **Review + Create**\\n24. Click **Create**\\n\\n_Note: I had an API error; after some investigation, I found it was having problems with the \'?\' in my experiment name, so I removed it and continued to create the Experiment._\\n\\n#### Assign permissions for the Experiments\\n\\nNow that the Experiment has been created, we need to give rights to the Managed User account created earlier _(and/or the System managed identity that was created when the Experiment was created for service-direct experiments)_.\\n\\nI will assign permissions to the Resource Group that the VM Scale set exists in, but you might be better off applying the rights to the individual resource for more granular control. You can see suggested roles to give resources: [Supported resource types and role assignments for the Chaos Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/chaos-studio-fault-providers?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) Microsoft page.\\n\\n 1.

Click on **+ Select Members**\\n 9. **Select** the **User** assigned **management identity**\\n10. Click **Review** and **assign**.\\n11. Because the shutdown is a service-direct, **go back and give the experiment system managed identity Virtual Machine Contributor rights**, so it has access to shutdown the VM.\\n\\n#### Run Experiments\\n\\nNow that the Experiment has been created, it should appear as a resource in the resource group you selected earlier; if you open it, you can see the Experiment\'s History, Start, and Edit buttons.\\n\\n1.

Do you want to enforce or use Azure Conditional Access policies to protect and manage access?\\n\\nLet me introduce the Microsoft Microsoft Entra ID Application Proxy...\\n\\n> Application Proxy is a feature of Azure AD that enables users to access on-premises web applications from a remote client. Application Proxy includes both the Application Proxy service which runs in the cloud, and the Application Proxy connector, which runs on an on-premises server. Azure AD, the Application Proxy service, and the Application Proxy connector work together to securely pass the user sign-on token from Azure AD to the web application. Application Proxy also supports single sign-on.\\n>\\n> Application Proxy is recommended for giving remote users access to internal resources. Application Proxy replaces the need for a VPN or reverse proxy.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe [Microsoft Entra ID Application Proxy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/what-is-application-proxy?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)has been around for a few years, but appears to be a hidden gem; the Application Proxy allows users_(by using Microsoft Entra ID and an Application Proxy Connector(s))_ to connect to internally hosted web applications, by the connector relaying the traffic.\\n\\n![Azure Application Proxy - Network Diagram](/uploads/aadproxynetworkdiagram.png \\"Azure Application Proxy - Network Diagram\\")\\n\\nApplication Proxy supports the following types of applications:\\n\\n* Web applications\\n* Web APIs that you want to expose to rich applications on different devices\\n* Applications hosted behind a Remote Desktop Gateway\\n* Rich client apps that are integrated with the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)\\n\\nAzure Application Proxy can often be overlooked to solve your business requirements without the need to implement costly third-party firewalls _(it also doesn\'t have to be an on-premises workload, for example, if the web application is running on a VM in Azure, it will also work)_.\\n\\nThe Azure Application proxy connector is a lightweight agent installed on a Windows Server machine that is logically close to the backend service that you want to deliver through the proxy. \\n\\nThe Connector gives access to and relays the information to the Application proxy service in Microsoft Azure via HTTP/HTTPS as long as it has access to the following:\\n\\n| URL | Port | How it\'s used |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| *.msappproxy.net  *.servicebus.windows.net | 443/HTTPS | Communication between the connector and the Application Proxy cloud service |\\n| crl3.digicert.com  crl4.digicert.com  ocsp.digicert.com  crl.microsoft.com  oneocsp.microsoft.com  ocsp.msocsp.com | 80/HTTP | The connector uses these URLs to verify certificates. |\\n| login.windows.net  secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com  *.microsoftonline.com  *.microsoftonline-p.com  *.msauth.net  *.msauthimages.net  *.msecnd.net  *.msftauth.net  *.msftauthimages.net  *.phonefactor.net  enterpriseregistration.windows.net  management.azure.com  policykeyservice.dc.ad.msft.net  ctldl.windowsupdate.com  www.microsoft.com/pkiops | 443/HTTPS | The connector uses these URLs during the registration process. |\\n| ctldl.windowsupdate.com | 80/HTTP | The connector uses this URL during the registration process. |\\n\\n## Setup Azure Application Proxy\\n\\nI will set up an Azure Application Proxy to grant access to my Synology NAS _(Network Attached Storage)_ device web page in this guide. \\n\\nAlthough I am using my local NAS web administration page, it can be any webpage _(Unifi Controller, hosted on Apache, IIS etc.)_ accessible from the connector.\\n\\n* I have a Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller.\\n* Synology NAS _(not domain joined, but accessible on the network via a DNS record from the domain)_\\n* Microsoft 365 Developer subscription with appropriate licenses\\n\\n### Pre-requisites for Azure Application Proxy setup\\n\\nThe following resources and rights will be needed to set up Azure Application Proxy:\\n\\n* An Microsoft Entra ID tenant\\n* A minimum of Application Administrator rights is required to set up the Application and user and group assignments.\\n* A server running Windows Server 2012 R2 or above to install the Application Proxy connector on (and the permissions to install)\\n* If you are using a third-party domain _(you will need a public SSL certificate)_ and, of course, the ability to edit external DNS records, the domain will need to be added to Microsoft Entra ID as a custom domain in order to be used.\\n* Microsoft Entra ID Premium P1 license or M365 Business Premium/E3 license for each user using Microsoft Entra ID Application Proxy.\\n\\n![Microsoft Entra ID Application Proxy Licensing](/uploads/aadproxylicensing.png \\"Microsoft Entra ID Application Proxy Licensing\\")\\n\\n_(Note: Normal [Azure AD service limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/directory-service-limits-restrictions?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) and restrictions apply)_.\\n\\nI will be configuring the Azure Application Proxy on a domain controller running Windows Server 2022.\\n\\n### Disable IE Enhanced Security Configuration\\n\\nThe Azure Application Proxy connector requires you to log in to Microsoft Azure, and I will be installing this on a Windows Server 2022 domain controller; if this Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled _(as it should be),_ you will have problems authenticating to Microsoft Azure, so the easiest thing is to turn it off temporarily.\\n\\n1. Open **Server Manager**\\n2. Click on **Local Server**\\n3. Click on: **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**\\n4. Select Off for: **Administrators**\\n5. **Close** Microsoft **Edge** _(if you have it opened)_\\n6. ![Disable IE Enhanced Security Configuration](/uploads/disable_ie_enhancedconfiguration.png \\"Disable IE Enhanced Security Configuration\\")\\n\\n### Install Azure Application Proxy Connector\\n\\n 1. Login to **Azure Portal** _(on the server that you want to install the Connector on)_\\n 2. Navigate to: [**Microsoft Entra ID**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview)\\n 3.

Wait for the Microsoft Microsoft Entra ID Application to display and **log in** with an Microsoft Entra ID account with Application Administrator rights.\\n11. The Microsoft Microsoft Entra ID Application **Connector will now** be **registered** in your Microsoft Entra ID tenancy.\\n12. ![Microsoft Microsoft Entra ID Application Proxy Connector Installation](/uploads/microsoftazureapplicationproxyconnectorinstalled.png \\"Microsoft Microsoft Entra ID Application Proxy Connector Installation\\")\\n13. Click **Close**\\n14. Now **re-enable IE enhanced security configuration**.\\n\\nYou should now see two new services appear in services as Automatic (Delayed Start):\\n\\n* WAPCsvc - Microsoft AAD Application Proxy Connector\\n* WAPCUpdaterSvc - Microsoft AAD Application Proxy Connector Updater\\n\\nAnd the following processes running:\\n\\n* ApplicationProxyConnectorService\\n* ApplicationProxyConnectorUpdateService\\n\\n![ApplicationProxyConnectorService](/uploads/azureaadapplicationservices.png \\"ApplicationProxyConnectorService\\")\\n\\nIf you are running Server Core, Microsoft Microsoft Entra ID Application Proxy can be installed via [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-register-connector-powershell?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n\\nThe Azure Application Proxy Connector agent gets [updated](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-faq?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#why-is-my-connector-still-using-an-older-version-and-not-auto-upgraded-to-latest-version-) automatically when a new major version is released by Microsoft.\\n\\n### Configure Connector Group\\n\\nNow that you have created the Connector, the Application Proxy has put our Connector in a group that has defaulted to Asia; because you can have more than one Application Proxy Connector for redundancy and different applications, we will create a new Connector Group that is set to use the Australia region if Asia works for you \u2013 feel free to skip this step.\\n\\n 1. Login to **Azure Portal** _(on any PC/server)_\\n 2. Navigate to: [**Microsoft Entra ID**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview)\\n 3. Select **Application Proxy**\\n 4. You should now see: Default and your Region\\n 5. If you **expand** the Default **Group**, will you see your Connector:\\n 6. ![Azure AD Application Proxy Connector Groups](/uploads/azureportal-applicationproxyconnector.png \\"Azure AD Application Proxy Connector Groups\\")\\n 7. Click on **+ New Connector Group**\\n 8. Give it a **name** _(i.e., On-premises_)\\n 9. **Select** the **Connector** you had earlier and **select the** region closest to you _(currently, the following regions can be chosen: Asia, Australia, Europe, North America)_\\n10. ![Azure AD Application Proxy - New Connector Group](/uploads/azureportal-applicationproxynewconnectorgroup.png \\"Azure AD Application Proxy - New Connector Group\\")\\n11. **Click + Create**\\n12. Clicking create will create your new On-premises connector group and add the Connector to the group.\\n\\n### Configure your Azure Application Proxy Application\\n\\nNow that you have your Connector setup, its time to set up your application\\n\\n1. Login to **Azure Portal** _(on any PC/server)_\\n2. Navigate to: [**Microsoft Entra ID**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview)\\n3. Select **Application Proxy**\\n4. Click on: **+ Configure an app**\\n5. **Fill** in the **details** that match your **application**:\\n\\n* **Name**: This is the application that users will see _(i.e. I am going with Pizza, which is the name of my NAS)_\\n* **Internal URL**: This is the internal URL used to access your application inside the network _(in my example, it is:_ [_http://pizza.corp.contoso.com/_](http://pizza.corp.contoso.com/)_)_\\n* **External Url**: This is the external URL that will be created so that users can access the application form; _I will go with Pizza._ Note this URL down.\\n* **Pre-Authentication**: You don\'t have to authenticate with Azure AD, you can use passthrough, but it is not something I would recommend without delving into requirements, testing _\u2013 I am going to select: Microsoft Entra ID._\\n* **Connector Group**: Select the connector group you created earlier or that your Connector is signed to.\\n* **Leave** all **Additional Settings as default** \u2013 they can be changed later if you need to.\\n  1. ![Azure Application Proxy](/uploads/azureportal-applicationproxynewapplication.png)\\n  2. **Verify** that **everything** is filled out **correctly** and, click **+ Add**\\n  3. Azure **Application Proxy has now created a new Enterprise Application for you**; based on the name mentioned earlier, if you navigate to the external URL mentioned earlier, you should get a prompt similar to below:\\n  4. ![Azure AD Login Error](/uploads/azureportal-pizzaloginerror.png \\"Azure AD Login Error\\")\\n  5. It is now time to assign the permissions for users to access the Application via Microsoft Entra ID!\\n\\n### Assign rights to your Azure Application Proxy Application\\n\\n 1.

Click on: **Current repository** to make sure your repository is selected.\\n 3. ![Github Desktop - Initial Commit](/uploads/githubdesktop-initialhelloworld.png \\"Github Desktop - Initial Commit\\")\\n 4. In my example, I have created a new file called: HelloWorld.ps1 in my PowerShell repository.\\n 5. What you can see in the screenshot below is the various components that make up the Github Desktop; you can see the changed file _(i.e. the new file)_, the contents of the file and what will be added, the commit title and the all-important commit description.\\n 6. ![Github Desktop - Overview](/uploads/githubdesktop-productoverview.png \\"Github Desktop - Overview\\")\\n 7. You can **change** the **title** to something more appropriate if you want, but with your commit **description**, this is what you will use for versioning and seeing what changes you made in the future from a quick glance \u2013 make sure it\'s an appropriate description and click **Commit** to master.\\n 8. Committing it to master does not push it to its \'Origin\'. I.e. the actual remote git repository _(stored in Github or Azure DevOps)_ will commit to the local git repository. This allows you to work on code locally without requiring every change to be uploaded to a local repository. In order to commit to the Origin and remote repository, click on: **Push Origin**.\\n 9. ![Github Desktop - Header](/uploads/githubdesktop-header.png \\"Github Desktop - Header\\")\\n10. Once it has been committed, you should be able to see the file on the origin git repository, and you can Push multiple local git changes at once.\\n11. If you click on: **History** should now **see your commit** with your file and description _(as you can see, I was using an old PowerShell repository that I had merged into other repositories since then but thought it was worth using it for this article)._\\n12. ![Github Desktop - Initial commit](/uploads/githubdesktop-initialhelloworldcommit.png \\"Github Desktop - Initial commit\\")\\n\\nCongratulations, you now committed your first file into Git! It wasn\'t that difficult!\\n\\n#### Restore file from the previous version\\n\\nOne of the benefits of using Git is version control and restoring a file if something stops working, or someone had an \'Oops!\' moment! With Github Desktop, restoring a previous version is straightforward.\\n\\n1. Open **Github Desktop**\\n2. Click on: **Current repository** to make sure your repository is selected\\n3. Click on **History** _(you may need to click Fetch Origin if files have been updated remotely)_\\n4. As you can see, someone _(i.e. Luke Murray)_ has **made a** **change** to my\' HelloWorld. ps1\'\' file, to be: \\"I like Unicorn\\" and changed the background and foreground colour to be both Yellow\'.\\n5. I can **right-click** that **file** and select **Revert changes** in the commit using Github Desktop.\\n6. ![Github Desktop - Revert changes](/uploads/githubdesktop-revertchanges.png \\"Github Desktop - Revert changes\\")\\n7. You will now have a new entry in the History that will revert the commit, and you can quickly **push it** back to **Origin** again.\\n\\nCongratulations, you have successfully reverted a commit to a previous version using Github Desktop.\\n\\n#### Working with branches\\n\\nA significant function of Git is the ability to create and use branches. Branches allow you to work on features without touching the main or master branch _(where you can have your production or thoroughly tested resources, for example)_.\\n\\n 1. Open **Github Desktop**\\n 2. Click on: **Current repository** to make sure your repository is selected\\n 3. To **create** a branch, click on the **Current branch** and select **New branch** and give it a name, _i.e. Dev_\\n 4. **Make** a **change** to the **file** like you typically would and **save**\\n 5. Github Desktop has automatically added your changes, and you can **commit** them to the **dev branch** without touching master.\\n 6. ![Github Desktop - Branch commit](/uploads/githubdesktop-branchcommit.png \\"Github Desktop - Branch commit\\")\\n 7. If you navigate to the master branch, you can see that the file has remained untouched. All the control and versioning is done by Git!\\n 8. When you are **ready** to **merge** the dev branch into master, click the **current branch**.\\n 9. Select: **Choose a branch** to **merge** into master\\n10. **Select** your **branch**, _i.e. Dev_\\n11. ![Github Desktop - Merge branch](/uploads/githubdesktop-branchmerge.png \\"Github Desktop - Merge branch\\")\\n12. Click on **create a merge commit**.\\n13. You should see a message in Github notifying that the merge was successful, and you can **push** your **changes** to the **origin** repository.\\n14. Github Desktop should redirect you to the master branch, and you can **now see** your **changes**:\\n15. ![Github Desktop ](/uploads/githubdesktop-branchcommited.png)\\n16. You can go back to using Dev to develop additional features, testing etc. and repeat the same process.\\n\\nUsing a master branch allows others to get production-ready scripts or code, or avoid automation around continuous deployment to production resources, while you may be still working on functionality that you don\'t quite want to be released yet.\\n\\nHopefully, this article gives you an excellent base to start your git journey! \\n\\nThere is a lot more functionality built into Github Desktop, especially around branching, but for day to day use, the above should give you all you need! \\n\\nIt is also worth reading this article on the .[gitignore](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore \\" .gitignore \\") file, to make sure your git repositories don\'t end up bloated by unwanted files and you are only committing the files you need to be."},{"id":"azure/azure-bicep-and-insert-resource","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/azure-bicep-and-insert-resource","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-29-azure-bicep-and-insert-resource.md","title":"Azure Bicep and Insert Resource","description":"Azure Bicep is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources declaratively.

As an Azure PaaS _(Platform as a Service)_ resource, it offers additional flexibility, reduces operational overhead, and increases redundancy and scalability.\\n\\nWe will run through the initial setup of the Azure Storage account using the Azure Portal.\\n\\nSFTP using an Azure Storage account does not support shared access signature (SAS) or Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication for connecting SFTP clients. Instead, SFTP clients must use a password or a Secure Shell _(SSH)_ private/public keypair.\\n\\nBefore we head into the implementation, just a bit of housekeeping, this is currently still in Preview at the time this post was written; the functionality MAY change by the time it becomes GA (_Generally Available)_.\\n\\n> During the public preview, the use of SFTP does not incur any additional charges. However, the standard transaction, storage, and networking prices for the underlying Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 account still apply. SFTP might incur additional charges when the feature becomes generally available.

You can also enable SFTP as you create the account.\\n* The account redundancy option of the storage account is set to either locally-redundant storage (LRS) or zone-redundant storage (ZRS); GRS is not supported.\\n* The hierarchical namespace feature of the account must be enabled for existing storage accounts. To enable the hierarchical namespace feature, see [Upgrade Azure Blob Storage with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/upgrade-to-data-lake-storage-gen2-how-to?tabs=azure-portal&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796).\\n* If you\'re connecting from an on-premises network, make sure that your client allows outgoing communication through port 22. The SFTP uses that port.\\n\\n#### Fill out the SFTP Public Preview Interest Form\\n\\nBecause the SFTP functionality is currently in Private Preview, Microsoft has asked that anyone interested in the SFTP Preview fill out a Microsoft Forms:\\n\\n* [SFTP Public Preview Interest Form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRxE4mlJMX2FKhD4ROGugH69URjBGVVdNSVRRWVUxSFA3WkM5OVk4STJFQS4u \\"SFTP Public Preview Interest Form\\")\\n\\nThis MAY be required before proceeding to the following steps; initially, I believe this was required - but there appears to have been a few people who I know have registered the feature without the form - either way, the SFTP Public Preview Interest form, is a good opportunity to supply your use-case information to Microsoft directly, to help improve the nature of the service going forward.\\n\\n#### Registering the Feature\\n\\nTo create an Azure Storage account that supports SFTP - we need to enable the Preview Feature.\\n\\n1.

Navigate to: **Subscriptions**\\n3. **Select** the **Subscription** that you want to enable **SFTP** preview for\\n4. Click on: **Preview features**\\n5. Search for: **SFTP**\\n6. Click on: **SFTP support for Azure Blob Storage** and click **Register** - _this may take from minutes to a few days to be registered, as each preview request may need to be manually approved by Microsoft personnel based on the Public Preview Interest form - my feature registration occurred quite quickly, so there is a chance that they either have automated the approvals or I was just lucky._\\n\\n   _As you can see in the screenshot below, I had already registered mine:_\\n7. ![Azure Portal SFTP Preview Feature](/uploads/azureportal_sftppreview.png \\"Azure Portal SFTP Preview Feature\\")\\n8. You can continue to hit refresh until it changes from: Registering to Registered.\\n9. While we are here, let\'s check that the Microsoft.Storage resource provider is registered _(it should already be enabled, but it is a good opportunity to check before attempting to create a resource and get a surprise_), by clicking on Resource providers in the left-hand side menu and search for: Storage, if it is set to NotRegistered - click on Microsoft.Storage and click Register.\\n\\nTo register the SFTP feature using PowerShell, you can run the following cmdlet:\\n\\n    Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName \\"AllowSFTP\\" -ProviderNamespace \\"Microsoft.Storage\\"\\n\\n#### Create the Azure Storage Account\\n\\nNow that the Preview feature has been registered, we can now create a new Storage account.\\n\\n 1.

Click **Next: Data Protection**\\n20. Here you can enable [soft-delete](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/soft-delete-blob-overview \\"Soft delete for blobs\\") for your blobs and containers, so if a file is deleted, it is retained for seven days until it\'s permanently deleted; I am going to leave mine set as the default of 7 days and click: **Next: Tags.**\\n21. Add in any applicable Tags, i.e. who created it, when you created it, what you created it for and click **Review + Create**\\n22. Review your configuration, make sure that Enable SFTP is enabled with Hierarchical namespace and click **Create**.\\n\\nIn case you are interested in Infrastructure as Code, here is an Azure Bicep file I created to create a storage account ready for SFTP here that can be deployed to a Resource Group, ready for the next steps:\\n\\n```bicep title=\\"storageaccount.bicep\\"\\nparam storageaccprefix string = \'\'\\nvar location = resourceGroup().location\\n\\nresource storageacc \'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-06-01\' = {\\n  name: \'${storageaccprefix}${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}\'\\n  location: location\\n  sku: {\\n    name: \'Standard_ZRS\'\\n  }\\n  kind: \'StorageV2\'\\n  properties: {\\n    defaultToOAuthAuthentication: false\\n    allowCrossTenantReplication: false\\n    minimumTlsVersion: \'TLS1_2\'\\n    allowBlobPublicAccess: true\\n    allowSharedKeyAccess: true\\n    isHnsEnabled: true\\n    supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true\\n    encryption: {\\n      services: {\\n  \\n        blob: {\\n          keyType: \'Account\'\\n          enabled: true\\n        }\\n      }\\n      keySource: \'Microsoft.Storage\'\\n    }\\n    accessTier: \'Hot\'\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Setup SFTP\\n\\nNow that you have a compatible Azure storage account, it is time to enable SFTP!\\n\\n 1. Log in to the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Azure Portal\\")\\n 2. **Navigate** to the **Storage account** you have created for SFTP and click on it\\n 3. On the Storage account blade, under **Settings**, you will see: **SFTP**\\n 4. ![Azure Portal - Enable SFTP](/uploads/azureportal_storageaccountstpblade.png \\"Azure Portal - Enable SFTP\\")\\n 5. Click on **SFTP** and click **+ Add local user.**\\n 6. Type in the username of the user you would like to use _(remember you can have up to 1000 local users, but there is no integration into Azure AD, Active Directory or other authentication services currently_), in my example I will use: lukeftpuser\\n 7. You can use either _(and both)_ SSH keys or passwords, in this article - I am simply going to use a password so I select: **SSH Password**.\\n 8. Click **Next**\\n 9. Our storage account is empty, we now need to create a top-level container, so I will sect **Create new** and set the name to: ftp\\n10. I will leave the Public access level to **Private (no anonymous access)**\\n11. Click **Ok**\\n12. Now that the ftp container has been created, we need to **set** the **permissions**, I am simply going to give the permissions of Read, Create, Delete, List and Write. _It\'s worth noting, that if you only need to read or list contents, then that is the only permissions you need, these permissions are for the Container, not the folder, so you may find your users may have permissions to other folders in the same Container if not managed appropriately._\\n13. Now we set the **Home directory**. This is the directory that the user will be automatically mapped to, this is optional but if you don\'t have a Home directory filled in for the user, they will need to connect to the appropriate folders when connecting to SFTP manually. The home directory needs to be relative, ie: ftp/files _(the container name and the files folder, located in the ftp container)._\\n14. ![Azure Portal - Enable SFTP](/uploads/AzurePortal_SFTPLocalUsercreate.png \\"Azure Portal - Enable SFTP\\")\\n15. Because we specified Password earlier, **Azure** has automatically **created** a new **password** for that account, although you can generate new passwords - you are unable to specify what the Password is, make sure you **copy** this and **store** it in a password **vault** of some kind, the length of the password that was generated for me was: 89 characters.\\n16. ![Azure Portal - Enable SFTP](/uploads/azureportal_sftp_localusercreatepassword.png \\"Azure Portal - Enable SFTP\\")\\n17. You should see the connection string of the user, along with the Authentication method and container permissions.\\n18. ![Azure Storage Account SFTP - Local User Created](/uploads/azureportal_sftp_localusercreated.png \\"Azure Storage Account SFTP - Local User Created\\")\\n\\n### Test Connectivity via SFTP to an Azure Storage Account\\n\\nI will test Connectivity to the SFTP Azure Storage account using Windows 11, although the same concepts apply across various operating systems _(Linux, OSX, etc.)_.\\n\\n#### Test using SFTP from Windows using command prompt\\n\\n1. Make sure you have a copy of the Connection String and user password from the SFTP user account created earlier.\\n2. Open **Command Prompt**\\n3. Type in **sftp** CONNECTIONSTRING, example below and press Enter:\\n   * _sftp sftpstorageacc1337.lukeftpuser@sftpstorageacc1337.blob.core.windows.net_\\n4. If you get a prompt to verify the authenticity of the host matches (i.e. the name/URL of the storage account matches) and type in: Yes, to add the storage account to your known host\'s list\\n5. Press **Enter** and paste in the copy of the Password that was generated for you earlier.\\n6. You should be **connected to the Azure Storage account via SFTP**!\\n7. As you can see below, I am in the Files folder, which is my users home folder, and there is a file named: Test in it.\\n8. ![SFTP Windows](/uploads/sftp_windowstest.png \\"SFTP Windows\\")\\n\\n   > Once you have connected to SFTP using the Windows command line you can type in: **?**\\n   >\\n   > That will give you a list of all the available commands to run, ie upload files etc \\n\\n#### Test using WinSCP\\n\\n1. Make sure you have a copy of the Connection String and user password from the SFTP user account created earlier.\\n2. If you haven\'t already, download WinSCP and install it\\n3. You should be greeted by the **Login page** _(but if you aren\'t, click on Session, New Session)_\\n4. For the hostname, type in the **URL** for the **storage account** _(after the @ in the connection string)_\\n5. For the **username,** type in everything before the @\\n6. Type in your **Password**\\n7. **Verify** that the port is 22 and file protocol is **SFTP** and click **Login**\\n8. ![Azure SFTP - WinSCP](/uploads/sftp_winscptest.png \\"Azure SFTP - WinSCP\\")\\n9. ![Azure SFTP - WinSCP](/uploads/sftp_winscptest2.png \\"Azure SFTP - WinSCP\\")\\n\\nCongratulations!

Not only can you use it to roll out your Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure and manage existing workspaces and host pools - you can use it to create Virtual Machine images that can be used for Virtual Scale Sets, but Base also builds or Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts! In addition, WVDAdmin automates creating and using snapshots and virtual machine images in a simple point and click interface - that just works!\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\n* Azure subscription\\n* Resource Group\\n* Virtual Machine _(to be used as your master image)_\\n* Of course - WVDAdmin\\n\\nYou can download WVDAdmin from the following page:  [Azure Windows Virtual Desktop administration with WVDAdmin](https://blog.itprocloud.de/Windows-Virtual-Desktop-Admin/ \\" Azure Windows Virtual Desktop administration with WVDAdmin\\").\\n\\nAlso, make sure you have set up a [service principal](https://blog.itprocloud.de/Windows-Virtual-Desktop-Admin/#service-principal-functional-account \\"Service principal (functional account) Link\\") with the appropriate rights to the Resource Groups that holds your Virtual Machine.\\n\\nBefore proceeding ahead, **_make sure you have a virtual machine backup!_**\\n\\n### Capturing a Snapshot\\n\\nAlthough, possible to do using the Azure Portal, quickly taking an OS disk snapshot and then reverting the change can be a bit tedious, especially if you want to make a backup quickly of the operating system disk before patching or application upgrade, Snapshots are a lot quicker to take and work well for immediate and temporary recovery, especially when you want to quickly try something out - without having to wait for an Azure Backup. Please note this tool does not snapshot any data drives present.\\n\\n#### Capture a Snapshot\\n\\n 1. Open **WVDAdmin**\\n 2. On the \\"Welcome\\" tab, **enter** in your Azure **Tenant id**\\n 3. **Enter** in your **Service principal (application) ID** and **key**\\n 4. Click on **Reload all** - to connect to Azure\\n 5. **Expand Azure**\\n 6. **Expand Virtual Machines**\\n 7. **Expand** your **Resource group**; in my example; it is: SERVERS-RG\\n 8. **Right-click** your **server**; in my example, it is: Server2019\\n 9. Select **SnapShot-Create**\\n10. ![WVDAdmin - Create Snapshot](/uploads/snapshot-create.png \\"WVDAdmin - Create Snapshot\\")\\n11. WVDAdmin will then prompt you to verify that you want to create your Snapshot.\\n12. ![WVD - Verify Snapshot](/uploads/snapshot-create_verify.png \\"WVD - Verify Snapshot\\")\\n13. Confirm the server is correct and click **Ok**\\n14. Depending on the size of your disk, this process may only take a few seconds; the virtual Machine may experience a slight performance hit. Still, I did not lose RDP connectivity during the snapshot process in my testing.\\n15. Review the logs to make sure that the Snapshot has been created successfully:\\n16. ![Snapshot](/uploads/snapshot-create_verify_log.png)\\n17. You should now see the Snapshot in the Azure Portal, in the same Resource Group as the server.\\n18. ![Azure Portal - Snapshot](/uploads/snapshot-azureportal.png \\"Azure Portal - Snapshot\\")\\n\\n#### Restore a Snapshot\\n\\nBefore you proceed, just a warning that restoring the Snapshot will discard any changes made after the Snapshot. The virtual machine will also be deallocated, so it will stop any connections to it.\\n\\n 1. Open **WVDAdmin**\\n 2. On the \\"Welcome\\" tab, **enter** in your Azure **Tenant id**\\n 3. **Enter** in your **Service principal (application) ID** and **key**\\n 4. Click on **Reload all** - to connect to Azure\\n 5. **Expand Azure**\\n 6. **Expand Virtual Machines**\\n 7. **Expand** your **Resource group**; in my example; it is: SERVERS-RG\\n 8. **Right-click** your **server**; in my example, it is: Server2019\\n 9. Select **SnapShot-Restore**\\n10. ![Azure Disk Snapshot](/uploads/snapshot-restore.png \\"Azure Disk Snapshot\\")\\n11. **Select** the **Snapshot** you would like to **restore** to, and when you are ready, click **Ok**. This will force the Virtual Machine to be shut down and deallocated and the Snapshot to be restored.\\n12. ![Azure Disk Snapshot](/uploads/snapshot-restore_verify.png \\"Azure Disk Snapshot\\")\\n13. You may also start the VM from WVDAdmin, by right-clicking on the Virtual Server after the Snapshot restores and click: Start.\\n14. ![Azure Disk Snapshot](/uploads/wvdadmin-startvm.png \\"Azure Disk Snapshot\\")\\n15. Verify that your Virtual Machine is back up and running and remove any unneeded snapshots and disks from the Azure Portal, to reduce additional costs. If you intend to keep any around, make sure you add appropriate Tags and a review date so you know what and why they existed in the first place.\\n\\nA few things to note:\\n\\n* WVDAdmin gave me errors, stating that the \\"Recovering snapshot was not successful\\", however, this occurred after the Swapping disk process when the old disk was attempting to be deleted. The recovery did, in fact, reoccur; I then successfully deleted the disks in the Azure Portal manually.\\n* I also had the: _\\"Virtual machine agent status is not ready.\\"_ error occur. After the Virtual Machine had enough time to start the Azure agent, this self-resolved.\\n\\n### Capturing a Virtual Machine Image\\n\\nVirtual Machine images work well for Azure Virtual Desktop and Virtual Machines scale sets, where you want consistency between your various virtual machines. The same process I will run through works with Windows 10/11 along with Windows Server 2022 and below _(and I would also imagine Linux workloads)_. \\n\\nI will be using the Windows Server 2019 Virtual Machine I had created before, however with various applications that I want to be standard across new builds; in my demo I used chocolatey to install:\\n\\n* Adobe Reader\\n* Microsoft Visual C++ runtimes\\n* 7Zip\\n* VLC\\n\\nThen added a custom user policy to set the wallpaper. WVDAdmin will automatically generalise _(sysprep)_ the Machine for you by creating a \'Temp\' machine without touching your original Virtual Machine!\\n\\n#### Capture a Virtual Machine Image\\n\\n 1. Open **WVDAdmin**\\n 2. On the \\"Welcome\\" tab, **enter** in your Azure **Tenant id**\\n 3. **Enter** in your **Service principal (application) ID** and **key**\\n 4. Click on **Reload all** - to connect to Azure\\n 5. **Expand Azure**\\n 6. **Expand Virtual Machines**\\n 7. **Expand** your **Resource group**; in my example, it is: SERVERS-RG\\n 8. **Right-click** your **server**; in my example, it is: Server2019\\n 9. Select **Create a template image**\\n10. ![WVDAdmin - Create a template image](/uploads/vmimage-create.png \\"WVDAdmin - Create a template image\\")\\n11. WVDAdmin will then display the: **Capture Image tab.**\\n12. Type in an appropriate image name (make sure you understand it, add specific versioning etc.)\\n13. **Verify** that your Template **VM** is **correct**\\n14. Select your **Target Resource Group** for your **Image**\\n15. If you have a custom PowerShell script, you may add additional customisations. Add the script path here (_make sure it\'s publically accessible by Azure, i.e. Azure storage account, Github repository etc.)_.\\n16. Before proceeding to the next step, **your VM will be deallocated**\\n17. When you are ready, select **Capture**\\n18. WVDAdmin will then deallocate your VM and run through the following process:\\n19. Deallocate VM -> Create a snapshot of VM ->Create a temporary VM from the snapshot -> Generalise the VM -> deallocate temporary VM -> create the image -> delete temp VM resources\\n20. ![WVDAdmin - Capture Image](/uploads/vmimage-log.png \\"WVDAdmin - Capture Image\\")\\n21. You should now see your Image in your Azure Portal.\\n22. ![Azure - Custom Image](/uploads/inkedvmimage-azureportal.jpg \\"Azure - Custom Image\\")\\n23. You can now create additional Virtual Machines from your Custom image using the Azure Portal.\\n24. WVDAdmin can also copy your Custom Image into a Shared Image Gallery, or you can use it to create an Azure Virtual Desktop session host!\\n25. ![WVDAdmin - New Session Host](/uploads/wvdadmin_newsessionhost.png \\"WVDAdmin - New Session Host\\")\\n\\nHopefully, this article has been of some use - even if you don\'t use Azure Virtual Desktop - WVDAdmin is a great tool to help with day-to-day Azure Virtual Machine operations."},{"id":"/2021/12/11/cloud-adoption-framework-for-azure","metadata":{"permalink":"/2021/12/11/cloud-adoption-framework-for-azure","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-11-cloud-adoption-framework-for-azure.md","title":"Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure - Tools and Templates","description":"To help with your Microsoft Cloud Adoption and Azure migration, you need a few things to be successful:","date":"2021-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":2.32,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"date":"2021-12-11 00:00:00 +1300","title":"Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure - Tools and Templates","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"toc":false,"header":{"teaser":"images/posts/Microsoft_CloudAdoptionFramework_Azure.png"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Capturing Virtual Machine images and Snapshots in Azure using WVDAdmin","permalink":"/azure/capturing-virtual-machine-images-and-snapshots-in-azure-using-wvdadmin"},"nextItem":{"title":"Azure NAT Gateway - Implementation and Testing","permalink":"/2021/12/03/azure-nat-gateway"}},"content":"To help with your Microsoft Cloud Adoption and Azure migration, you need a few things to be successful:\\n\\n1.

That product is only accessible from your organisations IP for compliance/security reasons, you might access the CRM product from various Azure Virtual Desktop hosts, each with its public IP or a random Microsoft Azure datacenter IP, or you want to control Multifactor authentication/conditional access policies for users using Azure services_.\\n\\nThe administration of this, particularly in scenarios where other people or teams can create and manage resources, can be complex, sure; you can use Standard Load Balancers, which would help, but you have to manage and pay for it, which is sometimes overkill.\\n\\nTunnelling outbound traffic through to a specific IP address or IP addresses to _\'known controllable IP addresses_\' for Azure resources _(both IaaS and PaaS)_ which sit in the same Virtual Network is where the Azure NAT Gateway comes in, allowing you to easily allow and control what IPs your traffic is coming from. NAT Gateway replaces the default Internet destination in the virtual network\u2019s routing table for the subnets identified\\n\\n\\"The Azure NAT gateway is a fully managed, highly resilient service built into the Azure fabric, which can be associated with one or more subnets in the same Virtual Network, that ensures that all outbound Internet-facing traffic will be routed through the gateway. As a result, the NAT gateway gives you a predictable public IP for outbound Internet-facing traffic. It also significantly increases the available [SNAT ports](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-intermittent-outbound-connection-errors?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) in scenarios where you have a high number of concurrent connections to the same public address/port combination.\\"\\n\\n### My Testing\\n\\nNow lets get testing the Azure NAT Gateway! To test the gateway, I created:\\n\\n* Virtual Network\\n* NAT Gateway\\n* IP Public Address prefix\\n* 1 Windows VM (Windows Server 2019) with Public IP\\n* 1 Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) VM with Public IP\\n* 1 Windows VM (Windows Server 2019) as a backend pool for an Azure Load Balancer\\n* Virtual Machine Scale Set with four instances (each with Windows Server 2019)\\n\\n_Note: Each VM has RDP opened to allow inbound traffic from my network using the Public IP and a NAT rule allowing RDP traffic on the Load Balancer. There is no point-to-site or site-to-site VPN; RDP connections are directly over the internet to Australia East, from New Zealand._\\n\\n![NAT Gateway - Test](/uploads/natgw_test.png \\"NAT Gateway - Test\\")\\n\\nOnce the Azure resources were created, I then connected to each machine using RDP/SSH on their Public IP address and tested:\\n\\n#### Linux Machine with Public IP for RDP\\n\\n* Inbound Public IP: 20.53.92.19\\n* Outbound IP: 20.53.73.184\\n\\n![Linux Azure NAT Gateway](/uploads/linux_ubuntu_nat_test.png \\"Linux Azure NAT Gateway\\")\\n\\nAs you can see, I connected to the Linux VM\'s public IP via SSH and did a curl to: [https://ifconfig.me/](https://ifconfig.me/ \\"https://ifconfig.me/\\") to grab my public IP. The public IP of my Linux box was my NAT Gateway Public IP prefix!\\n\\n#### Windows Machine with Public IP for RDP\\n\\n* Inbound Public IP: 20.70.228.211\\n* Outbound IP: 20.53.73.184\\n\\n![Windows Azure NAT Gateway](/uploads/window_nat_test.png \\"Windows Azure NAT Gateway\\")\\n\\nUsing RDP to the public IP of the Windows Server, I navigated to: [https://www.whatismyip.com/](https://www.whatismyip.com/ \\"https://www.whatismyip.com/\\"). As you can see, the Public IP of my outbound IP address was my NAT Gateway Public IP prefix!\\n\\n#### Windows Machine behind an Azure Load Balancer\\n\\n* Inbound Public IP: 20.211.100.67\\n* Outbound IP: 20.53.73.185\\n\\n![Windows Machine behind Azure Load Balancer NAT Gateway](/uploads/windows_nat_test_loadbalancer.png \\"Windows Machine behind Azure Load Balancer NAT Gateway\\")\\n\\nThis was the last of the 3 test machines; I stood up. Using RDP to the public IP of the Azure Load BalancerI navigated to: [https://www.whatismyip.com/](https://www.whatismyip.com/ \\"https://www.whatismyip.com/\\"). As you can see, the Public IP of my outbound IP address was my NAT Gateway Public IP prefix; however, this was \'20.53.73.18**5**\', which was the second IP address available in my /31 IP address prefix.\\n\\n#### Windows Machine behind a VM Scale Set\\n\\nAlthough not in the diagram, I decided to add a VM Scale Set of 4 Virtual Machines into my testing _(to save on cost, they are just Standard_B2ms machines but more than enough for my testing)_.\\n\\n![Azure NAT Gateway - VM Scale Set](/uploads/vmss_nat_test.png \\"Azure NAT Gateway - VM Scale Set\\")\\n\\nAs you can see from the mess that is my screenshot above, all machines had completely different inbound Public IP addresses. Still, the outbound public IP addresses came from the NAT Gateway as expected.\\n\\n#### Findings and Observations\\n\\n* The outbound public IP did seem to change between the workloads; if I refreshed \'_whatismyip_\' and \'_ifconfig_\', the public IP changed between 184 and 185. However, no loss of connectivity occurred to the Virtual Machines. This was linked to the \'4-minute idle timeout\' configured on the NAT Gateway; I saw no reason to change the default timeout value; if I were that worried about the same IP address - I would have chosen with a Public IP vs a Public IP prefix on the NAT Gateway.\\n* Any Public IP used on the same subnet as a NAT Gateway needs to be Standard.\\n* If I had both a Public IP address and a Public IP prefix on my NAT gateway, the Prefix seemed to take precedence.\\n* You cannot use a Public IP Prefix that is in use by the NAT Gateway for any other workload, _i.e. any inbound Public IPs. It would be best if you had another Public IP prefix resource._\\n* A single [NAT gateway resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-gateway-resource?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) supports from 64,000 up to 1 million concurrent flows. Each IP address provides 64,000 SNAT ports to the available inventory. Therefore, you can use up to 16 IP addresses per NAT gateway resource. The SNAT mechanism is described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-gateway-resource?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#source-network-address-translation) in more detail.\\n\\n### Create a NAT Gateway\\n\\nTo create my NAT Gateway, I used the ARM Quickstart template, located here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/quickstart-create-nat-gateway-template](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/quickstart-create-nat-gateway-template?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/quickstart-create-nat-gateway-template?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796\\").\\n\\nThen I created the additional Virtual Machines and Load Balancers and added them to the same VNET created as part of the NAT Gateway.\\n\\n#### **To create a NAT Gateway using the Azure Portal**\\n\\n 1. Log in to the **Azure Portal** and navigate to **Create a resource**, **NAT Gateway** (this link will get you there: [Create-NATGateway](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Fquickstarts%2Fmicrosoft.network%2Fnat-gateway-1-vm%2Fazuredeploy.json \\"Create network address translation (NAT) gateway\\")).\\n 2. Select your **Subscription**\\n 3. **Enter** your NAT **Gateway name**\\n 4. Enter your **Region**\\n 5. Enter your availability zone\\n 6. Set your idle timeout _(I suggest leaving this at 4 minutes, you can change it later if it presents issues)_\\n 7. ![Create Azure NAT Gateway](/uploads/create_natgateway1.png \\"Create Azure NAT Gateway\\")\\n 8. Click **Next: Outbound IP**\\n 9. We are just going to **create** a new **Public IP address** (_it has to be Standard and Static, the Azure Portal automatically selects this for you - although you can create your Public IP prefix here for scalability, you don\'t need it both)_.\\n10. ![Create Azure NAT Gateway](/uploads/create_natgateway2.png \\"Create Azure NAT Gateway\\")\\n11. Click **Next: Subnet**\\n12. Create or **link** your existing **Virtual Network** and **subnets** and click **Next: Tags**\\n13. **Enter** in any **tags** that may be relevant _(Creator, Created on, Created for, Support Team etc.)_\\n14. Click **Next: Review  + Create**\\n15. Verify everything looks ok then click **Create**\\n\\n**Congratulations, you have now created your NAT Gateway!**\\n\\n#### **To create a NAT Gateway using Azure Bicep**\\n\\nJust a quick Bicep snippet I created to create the NAT Gateway resource only:\\n\\n```bicep title=\\"Create-NATGateway.bicep\\"\\n\\n//Target Scope is: Resource Group\\n\\ntargetScope = \'resourceGroup\'\\n\\n//Set Variables and Parameters\\n\\n@allowed([\\n  \'Prod\'\\n  \'Dev\'\\n])\\nparam environment string = \'Prod\'\\nparam location string = resourceGroup().location\\n\\nparam dateTime string = utcNow(\'d\')\\nparam resourceTags object = {\\n  Application: \'Azure NAT Gateway/Azure Network Management\'\\n  CostCenter: \'Operational\'\\n  CreationDate: dateTime\\n  Environment: environment\\n}\\n\\n//// Resource Creation\\n\\n/// Create - NAT Gateway\\n\\nresource NATGW \'Microsoft.Network/natGateways@2021-03-01\' = {\\n  name: \'aznatgw\'\\n  tags: resourceTags\\n\\n  location: location\\n  sku: {\\n    name: \'Standard\'\\n  }\\n\\n  properties: {\\n    idleTimeoutInMinutes: 4\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIt can be deployed by opening PowerShell _(after_ [_Bicep is installed_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#windows \\"Install Bicep tools\\")_using the PowerShell method)_and logging into your Azure and running the following_(replace RGNAME with the name of the Resource Group you will be deploying it to)_:\\n\\n_When you are actually ready to deploy, remove the -Whatif at the end.

you don\'t need to worry about some of these unfortunate events occurring.\\n* No need to pay electricity costs to host your workloads.\\n* Reduced IT labour costs and time to implement and maintain systems\\n* OnDemand resources available can stand up separate networks unattached to your production network for testing or other devices easily without working out through VLANs or complex switching and firewalls.\\n* Azure Network have standard DDOS protection enabled by default\\n* Backups are secure by default; they are offline and managed by Microsoft, so if a ransomware attack occurs, won\'t be able to touch your backups.\\n* Constant Security recommendations, improvements built into the platform.\\n* Azure Files is geo-redundant and across multiple storage arrays, encrypted at rest.\\n* Windows/SQL licensing is all covered as part of the costings, so need to worry about not adhering to MS licensing, Azure helps simplify what can sometimes be confusing and complex licensing.\\n* Extended security updates for out-of-date Server OS such as Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2021 R2 without having to pay for extended update support.\\n* Ability to leverage modern and remote desktop and application technologies such as Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop, by accessing services hosted in Azure.\\n* Having your workloads in Azure gives you a step towards, removing the need for traditional domain controllers and migrating to Microsoft Entra ID joined devices.\\n* Azure AutoManage functionality is built in to automatically patch Linux (and Windows of course!), without having to manage separate patching technologies for cross-platform infrastructure.\\n* Azure has huge support for Automation, via PowerShell, CLI and API, allowing you to standardize, maintain, tear down and create infrastructure and services, monitoring, self-users on an as needed basis.\\n* Azure datacentres are sustainable and run off renewable energy where they can, Microsoft has commitments to be fully renewable.\\n* No need for NAS or Local Backups, the backups are all built into Azure.\\n* Compliant datacentre across various global security standards - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/assurance/assurance-datacenter-security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/assurance/assurance-datacenter-security?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/assurance/assurance-datacenter-security?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796\\")\\n* Ability to migrate or expand your resources from Australia to \u2018NZ North\u2019 or other new or existing data centres! Azure is global and gives you the ability to scale your infrastructure to a global market easily or bring your resources closer to home if a data centre becomes available.\\n* We all know that despite the best of intentions, we rarely ever test, develop, and improve disaster recovery scenarios, sometimes this is because of the complexity of the applications and backup infrastructure. Azure Site Recovery, Geo-Redundant backup, Load Balancers and automation helps make this a lot easier.\\n* Ability to better utilise Cloud security tools _(ie such as the Azure Security Center)_, across Cloud and on-premises workloads consistently using Azure Arc and Azure policies.\\n* And finally - more visibility into the true cost and value of your IT infrastructure, the total cost of your IT Infrastructure is hidden behind electricity costs, outages and incidents that would not have impacted cloud resources, slow time to deployment or market, outdated and insecure technologies and most likely services you are running which you don\'t need to run!\\n\\n\\\\#ProTip - Resources such as the [Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator\\") can help you calculate the true cost of your workloads."},{"id":"/2021/08/25/always-on-vpn-error-809-the-network-connection-between-your-computer-and-the-vpn-server-could-not-be-established","metadata":{"permalink":"/2021/08/25/always-on-vpn-error-809-the-network-connection-between-your-computer-and-the-vpn-server-could-not-be-established","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-25-always-on-vpn-error-809-the-network-connection-between-your-computer-and-the-vpn-server-could-not-be-established.md","title":"Always on VPN - Error 809 The network connection between your computer and the VPN server could not be established ","description":"I ran into a weird issue, troubleshooting an \'Always On VPN\' installation running off Windows Server 2019, the clients were getting the following error in the Application event log:","date":"2021-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Windows","permalink":"/tags/windows"}],"readingTime":2.57,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"date":"2021-08-25 00:00:00 +1200","title":"Always on VPN - Error 809 The network connection between your computer and the VPN server could not be established ","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Windows"],"toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"/uploads/windows-server.jpg"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Benefits to using the Microsoft Azure Cloud to host your Infrastructure","permalink":"/2021/10/28/benefits-to-using-the-microsoft-azure-cloud-to-host-your-infrastructure"},"nextItem":{"title":"Update-AdmPwdAdSchema - The requested attribute does not exist","permalink":"/2021/08/21/update-admpwdadschema-the-requested-attribute-does-not-exist"}},"content":"I ran into a weird issue, troubleshooting an \'Always On VPN\' installation running off Windows Server 2019, the clients were getting the following error in the Application event log:\\n\\n> Error 809 The network connection between your computer and the VPN server could not be established\\n\\nIn my case, the issue wasn\'t due to [IKEv2 Fragmentation](https://directaccess.richardhicks.com/2019/02/14/troubleshooting-always-on-vpn-error-code-809/ \\"Troubleshooting Always On VPN Error Code 809\\") or anything to do with [NAT](https://directaccess.richardhicks.com/2020/04/13/always-on-vpn-ikev2-load-balancing-and-nat/ \\"Always On VPN IKEv2 Load Balancing and NAT\\") to allow the origin IP to flow to the Always-on VPN server.

No data is automatically uploaded to Microsoft.\\n>\\n> Please be aware that the script may change and include new functionality not part of this article, please review the Changelog and Readme of the script directly.\\n\\nA lot of the information below is contained in the script readme _(including a list of the extensive diagnostics and log locations)_ and changelog; however, I am supplying this article for reference and to help share this nifty tool.\\n\\n### Script pre-requisites\\n\\n1. The script must be run with elevated permissions to collect all required data.\\n2. All collected data will be archived into a .zip file located in the same folder as the script itself.\\n3. As needed, run the script on AVD host VMs and/or Windows-based devices from where you connect to the AVD hosts.\\n4. When launched, the script will present the Microsoft Diagnostic Tools End User License Agreement (EULA). You need to accept the EULA before you can continue using the script.\\n5. If the script does not start, complaining about execution restrictions, then in an elevated PowerShell console run:\\n\\n       \\tSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force -Scope Process\\n\\n_Acceptance of the EULA will be stored in the registry under HKCU\\\\\\\\Software\\\\\\\\Microsoft\\\\\\\\CESDiagnosticTools, and you will not be prompted again to accept it as long as the registry key is in place._ _You can also use the \\"-AcceptEula\\" command line parameter to accept the EULA silently._ _This is a per-user setting, so each user running the script will accept the EULA once._\\n\\n### Script scenarios\\n\\n#### Core - suitable for troubleshooting issues that do not involve Profiles or Teams or MSIX App Attach\\n\\n* Collects core troubleshooting data without including Profiles/FSLogix/OneDrive or Teams or MSIXAA related data\\n* Runs Diagnostics.\\n\\n#### Core + Profiles - suitable for troubleshooting Profiles issues\\n\\n* Collects all Core data\\n* Collects Profiles/FSLogix/OneDrive related information, as available\\n* Runs Diagnostics. \\n\\n#### Core + Teams - suitable for troubleshooting Teams issues\\n\\n* Collects all Core data\\n* Collects Teams related information, as available\\n* Runs Diagnostics.\\n\\n#### Core + MSIX App Attach - suitable for troubleshooting MSIX App Attach issues\\n\\n* Collects all Core data\\n* Collects MSIX App Attach related information, as available\\n* Runs Diagnostics.\\n\\n#### Core + MSRA - suitable for troubleshooting Remote Assistance issues\\n\\n* Collects all Core data\\n* Collects Remote Assistance related information, as available\\n* Runs Diagnostics.\\n\\n#### Extended (all) - suitable for troubleshooting most issues, including Profiles/FSLogix/OneDrive, Teams and MSIX App Attach\\n\\n* Collects all Core data\\n* Collects Profiles/FSLogix/OneDrive related information, as available\\n* Collects Microsoft Teams related information, as available\\n* Collects MSIX App Attach related information, as available\\n* Runs Diagnostics.\\n\\n#### DiagOnly\\n\\n* Skips all Core/Extended data collection and runs Diagnostics only _(regardless of any other parameters that have been specified)_.\\n\\n**The default scenario is \\"Core\\".\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b**\\n\\n#### Available command line parameters (to preselect the desired scenario)\\n\\n* Core - Collects Core data + Runs Diagnostics\\n* Extended - Collects all Core data + Extended _(Profiles/FSLogix/OneDrive, Teams, MSIX App Attach)_ data + Runs Diagnostics\\n* Profiles - Collects all Core data + Profiles/FSLogix/OneDrive data + Runs Diagnostics\\n* Teams - Collects all Core data + Teams data + Runs Diagnostics\\n* MSIXAA - Collects all Core data + MSIX App Attach data + Runs Diagnostics\\n* MSRA - Collects all Core data + Remote Assistance data + Runs Diagnostics\\n* DiagOnly - The script will skip all data collection and will only run the diagnostics part _(even if other parameters have been included)_.\\n* AcceptEula - Silently accepts the Microsoft Diagnostic Tools End User License Agreement.\\n\\n### Usage example with parameters\\n\\nTo collect only Core data (excluding Profiles/FSLogix/OneDrive, Teams, MSIX App Attach):\\n\\n    \\t.\\\\AVD-Collect.ps1 -Core\\n\\nTo collect Core + Extended data (incl. Profiles/FSLogix/OneDrive, Teams, MSIX App Attach):\\n\\n    \\t.\\\\AVD-Collect.ps1 -Extended\\n\\nTo collect Core + Profiles + MSIX App Attach data\\n\\n    \\t.\\\\AVD-Collect.ps1 -Profiles -MSIXAA\\n\\nTo collect Core + Profiles data\\n\\n    \\t.\\\\AVD-Collect.ps1 -Profiles\\n\\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bIf you are missing any of the data that the script should normally collect, check the content of the \\"__AVD-Collect-Log.txt\\" and \\"__AVD-Collect-Errors.txt\\" files for more information. Some data may not be present during data collection and thus not picked up by the script.\\n\\n### Execute the script\\n\\n 1. **Download** the AVD-Collect **script** to the session host you need to collect the logs from, if you haven\'t already.\\n 2. **Extract** the **script** to a folder _(i.e. C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\%username&\\\\\\\\Downloads\\\\\\\\AVD-Collect)_\\n 3. Right-click on: AVD-Collect.ps1, select Properties\\n 4. Because this file has been downloaded from the Internet, it may be in a protected/block status - select **Unblock** and click **Apply**\\n 5. Open Windows Powershell as Administrator\\n 6. Now we need to **change** the **directory** for where the script is located; in my example, the command I use is:\\n\\n        cd \'C:\\\\Users\\\\Luke\\\\Downloads\\\\AVD-Collect\'\\n 7. By default, the script will run as \'Core\', and I want to include everything, profiles, Teams etc., so **run** Extended:  \\n\\n        .\\\\AVD-Collect.ps1 -Extended -AcceptEula\\n 8. **Read** the notice from the Microsoft Customer Support centre and press \'**Y**\' if you **accept** to move onto the next steps.\\n 9. The **script** will now **run**:\\n10. ![AVD- Script Running](/uploads/avd-collect_running.png \\"AVD- Script Running\\")\\n11. You will start to see new folders get created in the directory that the script is running from with the extracted log files. The script will take a few minutes to complete as it extracts the logs and then zips them.\\n12. Once the script has ran, there will now be a **ZIP file** of all the Logs collected by the script. In my example, the **logs** consisted of:\\n\\n* Certificates\\n* Recent Event Log\\n* FSLogix logs\\n* Networking\\n* Registry Keys\\n* Teams information\\n* System information\\n* Networking and Firewall information\\n\\n13. ![AVD-Collect Logs](/uploads/avd-collect-postrun.png \\"AVD-Collect Logs\\")\\n14. If needed, you can now **send** or upload the **ZIP** file to Microsoft **support**. If you are troubleshooting yourself, you can navigate to the folders to look at the specific logs you want, all in one place!\\n15. To **look** at **Diagnostic** information, open the: **AVD-Diag.html** file.\\n16. You can now see a list of common issues, what the script is looking for, and whether the host has passed or failed these scripts _(this can be very useful for Azure Virtual Desktop hosts, to make sure all the standard configuration is done or being applied, including making sure that the session host has access to all the external resources it needs_):\\n17. ![AVD-Collect Diagnostics](/uploads/avd-collect-diagreport.png \\"AVD-Collect Diagnostics\\")"},{"id":"/2021/07/18/implement-webjea-for-self-service-azure-resource-creation-with-powershell","metadata":{"permalink":"/2021/07/18/implement-webjea-for-self-service-azure-resource-creation-with-powershell","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-18-implement-webjea-for-self-service-azure-resource-creation-with-powershell.md","title":"Implement WebJEA for self-service Start/Stop of Azure Virtual Machines","description":"WebJEA allows you to build web forms for any PowerShell script dynamically.

Opening a lot of opportunities for automation without having to learn third party automation toolsets! Anyone who knows PowerShell can use it! Each script can be locked down to specific users and AD groups!\\n\\nYou can read more about WebJEA directly on the GitHub page: [https://github.com/markdomansky/WebJEA](https://github.com/markdomansky/WebJEA \\"https://github.com/markdomansky/WebJEA\\").\\n\\nThis guide will concentrate on setting up WebJEA for self-service Azure VM management. However, WebJEA can be used to enable much more than what this blog article covers, from things such as new user onboarding, to resource creation.\\n\\n![WebJEA - Start/Stop](/uploads/webjea_startstopazvm.png)\\n\\nWe will use a Windows Server 2019, running in Microsoft Azure, to run WebJEA from.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\n* Domain Joined server running Windows 2016+ Core/Full with PowerShell 5.1\\n* The server must have permission to go out over the internet to Azure and download PowerShell modules.\\n* CPU/RAM Requirements will depend significantly on your usage, start low _(2-vCPU/4GB RAM)_ and grow as needed.\\n\\nI\'ve created a Standard_B2ms _(2vCPU, 8GB RAM)_ virtual machine, called: WEBJEA-P01 in an Azure Resource Group called: webjea_prod\\n\\nThis server is running: Windows Server 2019 Datacenter and is part of my Active Directory domain; I\'ve also created a service account called: webjea_services.\\n\\n### Setup WebJEA\\n\\nOnce we have a Windows Server, now it\'s time to set up WebJEA!\\n\\n#### Setup Self-Signed Certificate\\n\\nIf you already have a certificate you can use, skip this step. In the case of this guide, we are going to use a self-signed certificate.\\n\\n**Log** into the WebJEA **Windows server** using your service account _(in my case, it is: luke\\\\\\\\webjea_services)_.\\n\\nOpen **PowerShell** ISE as Administrator, and after replacing the DNS name to suit your own environment, **run the following to create the Root CA and Self-Signed certificate**:\\n\\nNow that the Root CA is created and trusted, we want to create the actual self-signed certificate:\\n\\n    #Create RootCA\\n    $rootCA = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject \\"CN=MyRootCA\\"  `\\n    -KeyExportPolicy Exportable  `\\n    -KeyUsage CertSign,CRLSign,DigitalSignature  `\\n    -KeyLength 2048  `\\n    -KeyUsageProperty All  `\\n    -KeyAlgorithm \'RSA\'  `\\n    -HashAlgorithm \'SHA256\'  `\\n    -Provider \\"Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider\\"  `\\n    -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(10)\\n    \\n    #Create Self-Signed Certificate\\n    $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject \\"CN=WEBJEA-P01.luke.geek.nz\\"  `\\n    -Signer $rootCA  `\\n    -KeyLength 2048  `\\n    -KeyExportPolicy Exportable  `\\n    -DnsName WEBJEA-P01.luke.geek.nz, WEBJEA, WEBJEA-P01  `\\n    -KeyAlgorithm \'RSA\'  `\\n    -HashAlgorithm \'SHA256\'  `\\n    -Provider \\"Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider\\"  `\\n    -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddYears(10)\\n    $certhumbprint = $cert.Thumbprint\\n    \\n    #Add Root CA to Trusted Root Authorities\\n    New-Item -ItemType Directory \'c:\\\\WebJea\\\\certs\' -Force\\n    Export-Certificate -Cert $rootCA -FilePath \\"C:\\\\WebJEA\\\\certs\\\\rootCA.crt\\" -Force\\n    Import-Certificate -CertStoreLocation \'Cert:\\\\LocalMachine\\\\Root\' -FilePath \\"C:\\\\WebJEA\\\\certs\\\\rootCA.crt\\"\\n    \\n    Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green -Object \\"Copy this: $certhumbprint - The Thumbprint is needed for the DSCDeploy.ps1 script\\"\\n\\n**Copy** the **Thumbprint** _(if you do this manually, make sure it is the Thumbprint of the certificate, not the Trusted Root CA certificate)_; we will need that later.\\n\\n#### Setup a Group Managed Service Account\\n\\nThis is the **account** we will use to **run WebJEA under**; it **can** be a normal **Active Directory** user **account** if you feel more comfortable or want to assign permissions to.\\n\\nI am using a normal AD (Active Directory) service account in this guide because I am using Microsoft Entra ID Domain Services as my Domain Controller, and GMSA is not currently supported. I have also seen some scripts require the ability to create and read user-specific files. However, it\'s always good to follow best practices where possible.\\n\\n_Note: Group Managed Services accounts automatically renew and update the passwords for the accounts; they allow for additional security.

Instead, I will use a normal AD account as a service account _(i.e. webjea_services)_, but if you use a GMSA, you need to put the username in the AppPoolUserName; no credentials are needed _(make sure the GMSA has access to the server)_.\\n\\n**Change** the **following variables** to suit **your setup**; in my case, I have moved WebJEA resources to their own folder, so it\'s not sitting directly on the OS drive, but until its own Folder.\\n\\n| Variable | Note |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| NodeName | This is a DSC variable, leave this. |\\n| WebAppPoolName | WebApp Pool Name, it may be best to leave this as: WebJEA, however you   can change this. |\\n| AppPoolUserName | Add in your GMSA or Domain Service account username |\\n| AppPoolPassword | If using a Domain Account, add the password in here, if GSMA leave bank |\\n| WebJEAIISURI | This is the IIS URL, ie server/WebJEA. You can change this if you want. |\\n| WebJEAIISFolder | IIS folder location, this can be changed if you wanted to move IIS to   another drive or location. |\\n| WebJEASourceFolder | The source folder, this is the source folder for the WebJEA files when   they are first downloaded and extracted (ie Downloads directory) |\\n| WebJEAScriptsFolder | This is where the scripts folder will be placed (ie WebJEA installed) |\\n| WebJEAConfigPath | This is where the config file will be placed (ie WebJEA installed - it   needs to be the same location as the Scripts folder) |\\n| WebJEALogPath | WebJEA log path |\\n| WebJEA_Nlog_LogFile | WebJEA system log location |\\n| WebJEA_Nlog_UsageFile | WebJEA usage log location |\\n\\n![WebJEA - DSC](/uploads/webjea_dsc.png)\\n\\nOne thing to note is that the DSCDeploy.ps1 is calling _(dot sourcing)_ the DSCConfig deploy script; by default, it is looking for it in the same folder as the DSCDeploy.ps1 folder.\\n\\nIf you just opened up PowerShell ISE, you may notice that you are actually in C:\\\\\\\\Windows\\\\\\\\System32, so it won\'t be able to find the script to run; you can either change the script to point directly to the file location, or you can change the directory you are into to match the files, in my case in the Script pane I run the following:\\n\\n    cd \'C:\\\\Users\\\\webjea_services\\\\Downloads\\\\webjea-1.1.157.7589\'\\n\\nNow **run** the **script** and **wait**.\\n\\nIf you get an error saying that the script is not digitally signed, run the following in the script pane:\\n\\n    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass\\n\\nThis is because the PowerShell execution policy hasn\'t been set; depending on the scripts you are running, you may have to update the execution policy for the entire system, but for now, we will set it to Bypass for this process only, now re-run the script again, you should see DSC kick-off and start your configuration and setup of IIS and the WebJEA site.\\n\\n![WebJEA - DSC](/uploads/webjea_startingdsc.png)\\n\\nYou should also see the files/folders starting to be created!\\n\\n_Note: If you need to make a configuration change, please change it in the DSCDeploy.ps1, DSC will ensure that the configuration is applied as per your configuration and rerun the script, i.e. if you need to replace the certificate from a self-signed certificate to a managed PKI certificate._\\n\\nOnce DSC has been completed, your **server should now be running IIS and the WebJEA site**\\n\\nTo add the IIS Management Tool, this is not required but will help you manage IIS, run the following PowerShell cmdlet:\\n\\n    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName IIS-ManagementConsole\\n\\nOpen an Internet Browser and navigate to _(your equivalent of)_: [https://webjea-p01.luke.geek.nz/WebJEA](https://webjea-p01.luke.geek.nz/WebJEA \\"https://webjea-p01.luke.geek.nz/WebJEA\\").\\n\\nIf you need assistance finding the Website path, open the Internet Information (IIS) Manager, installed and uncollapse Sites, Default WebSite, right-click WebJEA, Manage Application and select Browse.\\n\\n![WebJEA - IIS](/uploads/webjea_iis_authentication.png)\\n\\nIf successful, you should get a username and password prompt:\\n\\n![WebJEA - IIS](/uploads/webjea_authentication.png)\\n\\nThat\'s normal - it means you haven\'t been given access and now need to configure it.\\n\\n### Configure WebJEA\\n\\nNow that WebJEA has been set up, it is time to configure it; the first thing we need to do is create a Group for WebJEA admins _(see all scripts)_.\\n\\n**Create an Active Directory group for:**\\n\\n* **WebJEA-Admins**\\n* WebJEA-Users\\n\\n**Add** your **account** to the: WebJEA-**Admins group**.\\n\\n**Navigate** to your **WebJEA scripts folder**; in my case, I set it up under c:\\\\\\\\WebJEA\\\\\\\\Scripts:\\n\\n![WebJEA - Scripts](/uploads/webjea_scripts.png)\\n\\nBefore we go any further, **take** a **Backup** of the config.json file, rename it to \\"config.bak\\".\\n\\n_I recommend using Visual Studio Code to edit the config.json to help avoid any syntax issues._\\n\\nNow right click **config.json** and open it to **edit**\\n\\nThis file is the glue that holds WebJEA together.\\n\\nWe are going to make a few **edits**:\\n\\n* Feel free to update the **Title** to match your company or Teams\\n* **Add in** the WebJEA-**Admins** group earlier _(include the Domain Name)_ into the permitted group\'s session - this controls access for ALL scripts.\\n\\n_Note the: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ for each path that is required. If you get a syntax error when attempting to load the WebJEA webpage, this is most likely missing._\\n\\n![WebJEA - Demo](/uploads/webjea_democonfig.png)\\n\\n**Save the config file** and **relaunch** the **WebJEA** webpage. It should now load without prompting for a username and password.\\n\\n**Set** the PowerShell **execution policy** on the machine to Unrestricted so that you can run any PowerShell scripts on it:\\n\\n    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope LocalMachine\\n\\n![WebJEA - Demo](/uploads/webjea_initialoverview.png)\\n\\nIf you get an: AuthorizationManager check failed error, it is because the PowerShell scripts are still in a blocked state from being downloaded from the internet, run the following command to unblock them, then refresh the WebJEA webpage:\\n\\n    Get-ChildItem -Path \'C:\\\\WebJEA\\\\scripts\\\\\' -Recurse | Unblock-File\\n\\n**You now have a base WebJEA install**! By default, WebJEA comes with 2 PowerShell files:\\n\\n* overview.ps1\\n* validate.ps1\\n\\nYou may have noticed these in the config.json file; WebJEA has actually run the overview.ps1 file as soon as the page loads, so you can have scripts run before running another one, which is handy when you need to know the current state of something before taking action.\\n\\nThe validate.ps1 script is an excellent resource to check out the parameter types used to generate the forms.\\n\\n### Setup Azure Virtual Machine Start/Stop\\n\\nNow that we have a working WebJEA install, it\'s time to set up the Azure VM Start/Stop script for this demo.\\n\\nOn the WebJEA server, we need to **install** the **Azure PowerShell modules**, run the following in Powershell as Administrator:\\n\\n    Install-Module Az -Scope AllUsers\\n\\n#### Create Service Principal\\n\\nOnce the Az PowerShell modules are installed, we need to **set** a **Service Principal** for the PowerShell script to connect to Azure to manage our Virtual Machines.\\n\\nRun the following PowerShell cmdlet to connect to Azure:\\n\\n    Connect-AzAccount\\n\\nNow that we are connected to Azure, we now need to create the SPN, run the following:\\n\\n    $sp = New-AzADServicePrincipal -DisplayName WebJEA-AzureResourceCreator -Role Contributor\\n    $BSTR = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($sp.Secret)\\n    $UnsecureSecret = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto($BSTR)\\n\\nNow you have created an SPN called: WebJEA-AzureResourceCreator. We now need to grab the Tenant ID, run the following:\\n\\n    Get-AzContext | Select-Object Tenant\\n\\nNow that we have the SPN and Tenant ID, it\'s time to test connectivity.\\n\\n    # Login using service principal \\n    $TenantId = \'TENANTIDHERE\' \\n    $ApplicationId = \'APPLICATIONIDHERE\'  \\n    $Secret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String \'SECRETSTRINGHERE\' -AsPlainText -Force \\n    $Credential = [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]::New($ApplicationId, $Secret) \\n    Connect-AzAccount -ServicePrincipal -Credential $Credential -TenantId $TenantId\\n\\nCopy the TenantID into the TenantID section\\n\\nType:\\n\\n    $sp.ApplicationID\\n\\nTo retrieve the ApplicationID created from the SPN in the previous step and add it into the ApplicationID part.\\n\\nType in:\\n\\n    $UnsecureSecret\\n\\nTo retrieve the Secret, created in the SPN and add it to the String.\\n\\nNow run the snippet, and you should be successfully connected to Azure.\\n\\n#### Create Get-VM script\\n\\nOne of the features of WebJEA is the ability to run scripts on page load. So, we will get the current Power State of our Azure VMs, in the **WebJEA scripts directory** to create a new PS1 file called: **Get-VM.ps1**.\\n\\nAdd the following script to it:\\n\\n    # Login using service principal \\n    $TenantId = \'TENANTIDHERE\' \\n    $ApplicationId = \'APPLICATIONIDHERE\'  \\n    $Secret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String \'SECRETSTRINGHERE\' -AsPlainText -Force \\n    $Credential = [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]::New($ApplicationId, $Secret) \\n    Connect-AzAccount -ServicePrincipal -Credential $Credential -TenantId $TenantId\\n    Get-AzVM -Status | Select-Object Name, PowerState, ResourceGroupName\\n\\n**Save** the file.\\n\\n#### Create Set-VM script\\n\\nNow, it\'s time to create the Script to Start/Stop the Virtual Machine. In the **WebJEA scripts directory**, create a new PS1 file called: **Set-VM.ps1**\\n\\nAdd the following script to it:\\n\\n    #Variables\\n    [CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess=$True,ConfirmImpact=\'Low\')]\\n    param\\n    (\\n    [Parameter(Position=1, mandatory=$true,\\n    HelpMessage=\'What is the name of the Azure Virtual Machine?\')]\\n    $VMName,\\n    [Parameter(Position=2, mandatory=$true,\\n    HelpMessage=\'What is the name of the Azure Resource Group that the Virtual Machine is in?\')]\\n    $RGName,\\n    [Parameter(Position=3, mandatory=$true,\\n    HelpMessage=\'What action do you want to do?\')]\\n    [VALIDATESET(\'Start\',\'Stop\')] \\n    $VMAction\\n    )\\n    # Login using service principal \\n    $TenantId = \'TENANTIDHERE\' \\n    $ApplicationId = \'APPLICATIONIDHERE\'  \\n    $Secret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String \'SECRETSTRINGHERE\' -AsPlainText -Force \\n    $Credential = [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]::New($ApplicationId, $Secret) \\n    Connect-AzAccount -ServicePrincipal -Credential $Credential -TenantId $TenantId\\n    Get-AzVM -Status | Select-Object Name, PowerState, ResourceGroupName\\n    if ($VMAction -eq \\"Start\\")\\n    {\\n         Start-AzVM -Name $VMName -ResourceGroupName $RGName -Confirm:$false  -Force\\n        return\\n    }\\n    elseif ($VMAction -eq \\"Stop\\")\\n    {\\n           Stop-AzVM -Name $VMName -ResourceGroupName $RGName -Confirm:$false  -Force\\n    }\\n\\n**Save** the file.\\n\\n#### Set VM in WebJEA Config\\n\\nNow that the scripts have been created, it\'s time to add them to WebJEA to use.\\n\\nNavigate to your scripts file and make a backup of the config.json file, then edit: config.json\\n\\nOn the line beneath the \\"onloadscript\\": \\"overview.ps1\\" file, add:\\n\\n},\\n\\nThen add in:\\n\\n    {\\n    \\"id\\": \\"StartStopAzVM\\",\\n    \\"displayname\\": \\"StartStop-AzVM\\",\\n    \\"synopsis\\": \\"Starts or Stops Azure Based VMs\\",\\n    \\"permittedgroups\\": [\\".\\\\\\\\Administrators\\", \\"luke.geek.nz\\\\\\\\WebJEAAdmins\\"],\\n    \\"script\\": \\"Set-VM.ps1\\",\\n    \\"onloadscript\\": \\"Get-VM.ps1\\"\\n     }\\n\\nSo your config.json should look similar to:\\n\\n```json title=\\"config.json\\"\\n\\n{\\n    \\"Title\\": \\"Luke Web Automation\\",\\n    \\"defaultcommandid\\": \\"overview\\",\\n    \\"basepath\\": \\"C:\\\\\\\\WebJEA\\\\\\\\scripts\\",\\n    \\"LogParameters\\": true,\\n    \\"permittedgroups\\": [\\".\\\\\\\\Administrators\\", \\"luke.geek.nz\\\\\\\\WebJEAAdmins\\"],\\n    \\"commands\\": [\\n{\\n        \\"id\\": \\"overview\\",\\n        \\"displayname\\": \\"Overview\\",\\n        \\"synopsis\\": \\"Congratulations, WebJEA is now working!  We\'ve pre-loaded a demo script that will help you verify everything is working.  <br/><i>Tip: You can use the synopsis property of default command to display any text you want.

You should be greeted by a window similar to below:\\n\\n![WebJEA - Demo](/uploads/webjea_startstopazvm.png)\\n\\n**Congratulations, you have now set up WebJEA and can Start/Stop any Azure Virtual Machines using self-service!**\\n\\n### Additional Notes\\n\\n* There is room for improvement around error checking, doing more with the scripts, such as sending an email when triggered, etc., to remind the server to be powered off.\\n* Because most of the configuration is JSON/PowerShell files, you could have the entire scripts folder in a git repository to make changes, roll back and keep version history.\\n* Remove any hard coding of any secrets to connect to Azure (as an example) from the scripts and implement a password management tool with API access or even the Windows Credential Manager. You want a system where you can easily update the passwords of accounts, limit access and prevent anything from being stored in plain text.\\n* Using the permitted group\'s section of the config.json file, you can restrict the ability for certain groups to run scripts this way, and you can set granular control on who can do what.\\n* If you use a normal Active Directory user account as the service account - then for added security, make sure that the WebJEA server is the only device that - that account can be logged in as and only has the permissions assigned that it needs to, look at implementing PIM (Privilaged Access Management) for some tasks so it only has access at the time that it needs it."},{"id":"/2021/07/13/validate-that-your-azure-resources-are-deployed-per-the-well-architected-framework","metadata":{"permalink":"/2021/07/13/validate-that-your-azure-resources-are-deployed-per-the-well-architected-framework","source":"@site/blog/2021-07-13-validate-that-your-azure-resources-are-deployed-per-the-well-architected-framework.md","title":"Well-Architected Framework Azure infrastructure review with PSRule for Azure","description":"Imagine if you could validate that your Azure Resources are deployed per the Well-Architected Framework (WAF).. just imagine!","date":"2021-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":5.445,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Well-Architected Framework Azure infrastructure review with PSRule for Azure","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"date":"2021-07-13 00:00:00 +1300","toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"/uploads/windowsterminal_data_psrules-azure.png"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Implement WebJEA for self-service Start/Stop of Azure Virtual Machines","permalink":"/2021/07/18/implement-webjea-for-self-service-azure-resource-creation-with-powershell"},"nextItem":{"title":"Configure Azure Virtual Desktop Monitoring Insights","permalink":"/2021/07/10/configure-azure-virtual-desktop-monitoring-insights"}},"content":"Imagine if you could validate that your Azure Resources are deployed per the Well-Architected Framework (WAF).. just **imagine**!\\n\\n**Of a way of validating your services are secure and deployed following the Azure Architecture framework, both before and after the resources have been created!**\\n\\nImagine no longer! There is a PowerShell module designed specifically for that purpose: **PSRule for Azure**.\\n\\n![PSRule - Azure](/uploads/windowsterminal_data_psrules-azure.png \\"PSRule - Azure\\")\\n\\nPSRule is a suite of rules to validate resources and infrastructure as code _(IaC)_ using PSRule, and the Azure component uses the base PSRule module.\\n\\nFeatures of [PSRule for Azure](https://azure.github.io/PSRule.Rules.Azure/ \\"PSRule for Azure\\")\\n include:\\n\\n* Leverage over 200 pre-built rules across five WAF pillars:\\n  * Cost Optimization\\n  * Operational Excellence\\n  * Performance Efficiency\\n  * Reliability\\n  * Security\\n* Validate resources and infrastructure code pre or post-deployment using Azure DevOps or Github!\\n* It runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.\\n\\nWith over 200 inbuilt rules _(and you can add your own),_ there is a lot of resource types covered, such as _(but not limited to)_:\\n\\n* Azure App Service\\n* Azure Key vault\\n* Azure Virtual Machine\\n* Azure Storage\\n* Azure Network\\n* Azure Public IP\\n\\nAzure PSRules has been in development since 2019 and is under constant updates and fixes.\\n\\nPSRule for Azure provides two methods for analyzing Azure resources:\\n\\n* Pre-flight - Before resources are deployed from Azure Resource Manager templates.\\n* In-flight - After resources are deployed to an Azure subscription.\\n\\nPre-flight validation is used to scan ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates before services are deployed and allow for quality gaps and better information in pull requests to improve and implement your infrastructure as code components.\\n\\nThe in-flight method can also be used in Azure DevOps for validation of Terraform resource deployments etc. Still, in this demo, I will run you through installing the Module and doing an export and scan from your PowerShell console!\\n\\nWe are going to install the PSRule.Azure _(based on the Well-Architected Framework & Cloud Adoption Framework)_.\\n\\nI recommend keeping the Modules _(and as such the in-built rules)_ up-to-date and do scans at least every quarter or after a major deployment or project to help verify your resources are set up according to some best-practice rules. This does not replace Security Center and Azure Advisor; this is intended to be a supplement.\\n\\n### Install PSRule.Azure\\n\\n1. Open **PowerShell** console and **run** the following **commands**:\\n\\n       #The main Module and base rules to validate Azure resources..\\n       Install-Module PSRule.Rules.Azure -Scope CurrentUser\\n\\n![Install-Module PSRule](/uploads/windowsterminal_install_psrules-azure.png \\"Install-Module PSRule\\")\\n2. Press \'**Y**\' to **accept PSGallery** as a trusted repository; just a note, you can prevent the confirmation prompt when installing Modules from the PSGallery, by classifying it as a \'Trusted Repository\' by running the following. Just be wary that won\'t get rechallenged:\\n\\n       Set-PSRepository -Name \'PSGallery\' -InstallationPolicy Trusted\\n3. You should now have the following modules installed:\\n\\n* PSRule\\n* PSRule.Rules.Azure\\n\\n### Extract Azure Subscription PSRule JSON files\\n\\nNow that PSRule has been installed, it\'s time to log in to Azure and extract information regarding your Azure resources for analysis; these extracted files are JSON files containing information, such as your resource names, subscription ID, etc. resource groups in plain text.\\n\\nAs you can see from the screenshot below, we can target specific Subscriptions, Tenancies _(yes, as long as the account you have access to has access to the subscription, you can export those as well)_, Resource Groups and Tags.\\n\\n![Export-AzRuleData](/uploads/powershellise_exportazruledata.png \\"Export-AzRuleData\\")\\n\\nBecause I want to get the most data available across all resources, I will target everything with the \'_-All_\' parameter.\\n\\n1. First, we need to connect to the Azure subscription and then **connect** to the **Azure** subscription we have access to or are targeting by running the following:\\n\\n       Connect-AzAccount\\n       \\n       Get-AzSubscription  | ogv -PassThru | Set-AzContext\\n2. Now that you have connected its time to export the Azure resource information, **run** the following **PowerShell** cmdlet, and **point** it towards an **empty folder**:\\n\\n       Export-AzRuleData -OutputPath c:\\\\temp\\\\AzRuleData -All\\n3. If the **folder doesn\'t** **exist**, _don\'t worry_ - the Export command will **create** it **for you**. Depending on how many resources and subscriptions you are extracting, this may take a few minutes.\\n\\nYou should **see** the **JSON files** appearing if you open one of these. In addition, you should be able to see information about the resources it has extracted.\\n\\n### Run PSRule across your JSON files\\n\\nNow that you have extracted the JSON files of your Azure resources, it\'s now time to analyse them following Microsoft Cloud Adoption and Well Architectured framework and the rules builtin into PSRule.Azure!\\n\\nYou don\'t need to be connected to Azure; for this analysis, have the PSRule modules installed and access the JSON files.\\n\\nPSRule.Azure has a few [baselines](https://azure.github.io/PSRule.Rules.Azure/en/baselines/Azure.All/ \\" PSRule for Azure - All Baselines\\"); these baselines contain the rules used to analyse your resources and range from Preview to newly released rules; again, we will target ALL rules, as we are after all recommendations.\\n\\n1. In **PowerShell, run** the following:\\n\\n       Assert-PSRule -Module \'PSRule.Rules.Azure\' -InputPath \'C:\\\\temp\\\\AzRuleDataExport\\\\*.json\' -Baseline \'Azure.All\'\\n2. This will trigger **PSRules** to **scan** your **extracted JSON** files with the **ALL** rules, and you will get **output** like below:\\n3. ![Invoke-PSRules](/uploads/windowsterminal_data_psrules-azure.png \\"Invoke-PSRules\\")\\n4. Although it is good being able to see a high level, I prefer to look at it all at once in Excel, so run the following to **export** the rules to a **CSV**:\\n\\n       Invoke-PSRule -Module \'PSRule.Rules.Azure\' -InputPath \'C:\\\\temp\\\\AzRuleDataExport\\\\*.json\' -Baseline \'Azure.All\' | Export-csv C:\\\\temp\\\\AzRuleDataExport\\\\Exported_Data.csv\\n5. You should now have a CSV file to review and look for common issues, concerns and work on improving your Azure infrastructure setup!\\n\\n![PS Rules Azure - Export CSV](/uploads/export_azruledata_excel.png \\"PS Rules Azure - Export CSV\\")\\n\\n_Note: The export contains the Subscription/Resource Names, so you can definitely see what resources can improve upon; however, I removed it from my screenshot._\\n\\n**Congratulations**! You now have more visibility and, hopefully, some useful recommendations for improving your Azure services!\\n\\n_If you want to get a good understanding of the type of data rules, check out my extracted CSV \'_[_here_](http://luke.geek.nz/uploads/files/Exported_Data_PSRuleAzure.csv)_\'._\\n\\n### Additional Resources\\n\\n* If you found PSRules.Azure interesting; how about getting any Failed rules?

As usual - it depends!\\n\\nCustom Roles can give people or objects JUST the right amount of permissions to do what they need to do, nothing more and nothing less, an example of this is maybe you are onboarding a support partner, if they are will only be supporting your Logic Apps, WebApps and Backups, you may not want them to be able to log support cases for your Azure resources; instead of attempting to mash several roles together that may give more or fewer rights than you need, you can create a custom role that specifically gives them what they need, you can then increase or decrease the permissions as needed, however, if a built-in role already exists for what you want. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, so use it!\\n\\nI will run through a few things to help arm you understand and build your own Custom Roles, primarily using PowerShell.\\n\\n### Install the Azure PowerShell Modules\\n\\nAs a pre-requisite for the following, you need to install the Azure (Az) PowerShell Module. You can skip this section if you already have the PowerShell modules installed.\\n\\n1. Open **Windows PowerShell**\\n2. Type **in**:\\n\\n       Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\\n       Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force\\n3. If you have issues **installing** the **Azure PowerShell module** - see the Microsoft documentation directly: Install the [Azure Az PowerShell module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-7.5.0&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Install the Azure Az PowerShell module\\").\\n4. Once you have the Azure PowerShell module installed, you can **connect to** your **Azure** subscription using the little snippet below:\\n\\n       #Prompts for Azure credentials \\n       Connect-AzAccount\\n       #Prompts Window allowing you to select which  Azure Subscription to connect to \\n       $subscriptionName = (Get-AzSubscription) | Out-GridView -Title \'Select Azure Subscription\' -PassThru | Set-AzContext -SubscriptionName $subscriptionName\\n\\n### Export Built-in Azure Roles\\n\\nOne of the best ways to learn about how an Azure Role is put together is to look at the currently existing roles.\\n\\n1. The following PowerShell command will **list** all **current** Azure **roles**:\\n\\n       Get-AzRoleDefinition\\n2. For a more human-readable view that **lists** the B**uilt-in Azure roles and their descriptions,** you can filter it by:\\n\\n       Get-AzRoleDefinition | Select-Object Name, Description\\n3. As you can see in the screenshot below, there are many various roles, from EventGrid Contributor to AgFood Platform Service and more! At the time of this article, there were 276 built-in roles.\\n4. ![Azure Builtin Roles](/uploads/az_roledefinitions.png \\"Azure Builtin Roles\\")\\n5. Now that we have successfully been able to pull a list of the existing roles, we will now **export** them as **JSON** files to take a proper look at them.\\n6. The PowerShell script below will create a few folders on your computer as a base to work from _(feel free to change the folders to suit your folder structure or access rights)_.\\n   * c:\\\\\\\\Temp\\n   * c:\\\\\\\\Temp\\\\\\\\AzureRoles\\n   * C:\\\\\\\\Temp\\\\\\\\AzureRoles\\\\\\\\BuiltinExports\\\\\\\\\\n   * C:\\\\\\\\Temp\\\\\\\\AzureRoles\\\\\\\\CustomRoles\\n7. Once the folders have been created, it will Get the Azure Role definitions and export them into JSON into the **BuiltinExports folder** to be reviewed.\\n\\n       New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path c:\\\\Temp -Force\\n       New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path c:\\\\Temp\\\\AzureRoles -Force\\n       New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path c:\\\\Temp\\\\AzureRoles\\\\BuiltInExports -Force\\n       New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path c:\\\\Temp\\\\AzureRoles\\\\CustomRoles -Force\\n       \\n       $a = Get-AzRoleDefinition\\n       \\n       Foreach ($role in $a)\\n       {\\n           $name = $role.Name\\n           Get-AzRoleDefinition -Name ($role).Name | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File c:\\\\Temp\\\\AzureRoles\\\\BuiltInExports\\\\$name.json\\n       }\\n8. Once completed, you should now **see** the **JSON files** below:\\n9. ![Azure Role - JSON files](/uploads/az_exportroles.png \\"Azure Role - JSON files\\")\\n\\n_Although you can use Notepad, I recommend using_ [_Visual Studio Code_](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)_to read these files. This is because Visual Studio Code will help with the syntax as well._\\n\\n### Review Built-in Azure Roles\\n\\nIf you open one of the roles, I will open the Azure Digital Twins Data Owner role; however, it doesn\'t matter.\\n\\nYou should see the following fields:\\n\\n* Name\\n* Id\\n* IsCustom\\n* Description\\n* Actions\\n* NotActions\\n* DataActions\\n* NotDataActions\\n* AssignableScopes\\n\\nThese fields make up your Role.\\n\\n![Azure Role - JSON](/uploads/az_rolereview_azdigitaltwinsdataowner.png \\"Azure Role - JSON\\")\\n\\n* The **Name field** is pretty self-explanatory - this is the name of the Azure Role and what you see in the Azure Portal, under Access control (IAM).\\n* ![Azure Portal - Role](/uploads/az_rolereview_azdigitaltwinsdataowneriam.png \\"Azure Portal - Role\\")\\n* The same is true for the: **Description** **field**.\\n\\n  _These are essential fields as they should tell the users what resource or resources the role is for and what type of access is granted._\\n* The **IsCustom field** is used to determine if the Azure Role is a custom made policy or not; any user-created Role will be set to True, while any In-Built role will be False.\\n* The **Actions field** is used to determine what management operations can be performed. However, the Azure Digital Twins role doesn\'t have any (as it is mainly Data Action based) if we look at another Role such as the: Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin role:\\n  * \\"\\"Microsoft.Authorization/*/read\\",\\n  * \\"Microsoft.Insights/alertRules/*\\",\\n  * \\"Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write\\",\\n\\n  You can see that it has the rights to Read the permissions, create and delete any Alert rules and update resources.\\n* The **NotActions field** is used to exclude anything from the Allowed actions\\n* The **DataActions field** allows you to determine what data operations can be performed. Usually, these are sub-resource tasks, where management or higher-level operations are performed in the Actions field, more specific resource actions are performed in the DataActions field.\\n\\n  The NotDataActions field is used to exclude anything from the Allowed actions in the DataActions\\n\\nTo help get a feel of the differences with the Actions, here is a list of Actions and DataActions for the Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Admin role:\\n\\n* ![Azure Custom Role - JSON](/uploads/az_rolereview_azkuberservicerbacactions.png \\"Azure Custom Role - JSON\\")\\n* And finally, the **AssignableScopes** is used to specify where the role will be available for assignment, whether it can be assigned at a subscription or resource group or management group level. You will notice that most if not all built-in Azure Roles have an Assignable scope of \\"/\\" - this means that it can be assigned everywhere _(Subscriptions, Resource Groups, Management Groups etc.)._\\n\\n### Review Azure Provider Namespaces\\n\\nYou may have noticed that each Action has a provider. In the example of a Virtual Machine, the provider is Microsoft.Compute.\\n\\n1. To get a **list** of all **current Providers,** run the following command:\\n\\n       Get-AzProviderOperation | Select-Object ProviderNamespace -Unique\\n\\n   At the time of writing, there are 198 current Providers! So that\'s 198 providers or overall buckets of resources that has permissions over.\\n2. We can **drill** into a **provider** a bit **further** to check out current Operations:\\n\\n       Get-AzProviderOperation -Name Microsoft.Compute/*\\n3. This **displays** a **list** of **all providers** within the Microsoft.Compute namespace, such as (but definitely not limited to):\\n   1. Virtual machines\\n   2. Virtual Machine Scale Sets\\n   3. Locations\\n   4. Disks\\n   5. Cloud Services\\n4. If we wanted to drill into the Virtual Machines **providers** a bit more, we could **filter** it like:\\n\\n       Get-AzProviderOperation -Name Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/*\\n5. Here we can finally see the available actions, and for example, the following Action will allow you to Read the VM sizes available to a Virtual Machine:\\n\\n* Operation: Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vmSizes/read\\n* operation name: Lists Available Virtual Machine Sizes\\n* ProviderNamespace: Microsoft Compute\\n* ResourceName: Virtual Machine Size\\n* Description: Lists available sizes the virtual machine can be updated to\\n* IsDataAction      : False\\n\\n1.

Pay for what you need when you need it._\\n\\nThe Azure Resource Manager fabrics allow you to scale up and down resources when you need it, whether built-in to the Azure portal or through various other automation mechanisms.\\n\\nFor Azure Virtual Desktop, this means ensuring that session hosts _(Virtual Machines)_ are available for users to connect to consume their services when they need it the most, whether first thing in the morning or late hours of the evening.\\n\\nOne of the technologies that can help with this is: [Start VM on Connect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/start-virtual-machine-connect?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Start VM On Connect\\")_(Start VM on Connect allows users to start the virtual machine from a deallocated state)_.\\n\\n> **You no longer need to create a Custom Role for Start VM on Connect - a built-in role now exists named:** [**Desktop Virtualization Power On Contributor**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-desktop/start-virtual-machine-connect?tabs=azure-portal&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#assign-the-desktop-virtualization-power-on-contributor-role-with-the-azure-portal) **- once that role is assigned to the Azure Virtual Desktop application, you can skip straight to Configure** \\n\\n* Imagine a 9 AM -> 5 PM Monday to Friday business; during the day, Azure Virtual Desktop is available, however anything out of these hours (through Scheduled Shutdowns or Azure Automation Runbooks etc.), the session hosts are shut down to reduce operational costs.\\n* A business user gets some urgent work on Saturday morning and then tries to connect to Azure Virtual Desktop resources to complete the work; because they were turned off outside of business hours, they can\'t connect and then have to ring IT support to get resources started (the alternative would be to leave Virtual Machines running, which may or may not be needed).\\n* Using \'Start Virtual Machine on Connect\', the moment that the user attempts to connect a Virtual Machine is started.\\n* Then it allows the users to log in and do their work without a call to IT, overall saving money, as the hosts are only started when they are first needed. The feature will also only turn on additional VMs (if available) when the first VM reaches the session limit.\\n\\nThis is a host-level setting, so setting \'Start VM on Connect\' will affect all session hosts in the host pool. Therefore, you cannot target specific Virtual Machines in a session host at this stage. This is now supported for both Personal and Pooled session hosts!\\n\\n> _As of 03/07/21 (NZ date format - DD/MM/YY): The Start VM on Connect feature is currently in public preview. This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it\'s not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.

These are in no particular order; they are just recommendations.\\n\\n### Configure Timezone Redirection\\n\\nTimezone redirection will allow you to pass through the time from the local device to the Azure Virtual Desktop host. This is useful to keep the consistent time between the device you are connecting from and the session host, and by default, the timezone in Azure is UTC.\\n\\n1.

By default, Remote Desktop Services allows users to disconnect from a Remote Desktop Services session without logging off and ending the session. Unfortunately, this means that sessions users sessions may remain open for an extended period of time, taking up usable resources.\\n\\nWhen configuring these, take into consideration a users normal work time, the time they have for lunch etc., the sweet spot to disconnect their session is not during their lunch break, but after they have finished for the day, usually 8-12 hours is recommended, but is dependant on how Azure Virtual Desktop is used.\\n\\n1.

RDP uses this transport to deliver Remote Desktop and RemoteApp while offering better reliability and consistent latency. RDP Shortpath establishes the direct connectivity between Remote Desktop client and Session Host. Direct connectivity reduces the dependency on the Azure Virtual Desktop gateways, improves the connection\'s reliability, and increases the bandwidth available for each user session.

When it\'s enabled, the feature monitors your device. When it\'s running low on space, it deletes temporary files, empties the Recycle Bin, cleans up the Downloads folder, removes previous installation files, and more to make space to install new updates or store more important data. Storage Sense can also help dehydrate files that are available locally and do not need to be stored locally anymore, helping to reduce profile space and OneDrive processing.\\n\\n_Note: If you find that Storage Sense is missing, it is because it is mainly a client setting and may be missing from the Windows Server; you can copy the PolicyDefinitions folder from an Azure Virtual Desktop host to your domains Central Store, i.e. in my case \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\luke.geek.nz\\\\\\\\SYSVOL\\\\\\\\luke.geek.nz\\\\\\\\Policies\\\\\\\\PolicyDefinitions. Or just look for StorageSense.admx and StorageSense.adml and copy it (the ADML goes in the language directory, i.e. en-US)._\\n\\n1.

To stop the prompt about open Applications we need to set a registry key - this is not an \'optimisation\' to be treated lightly, as it won\'t ask users to double check some of the apps they have open, as soon as they hit the logoff button - that it is, any open apps will be closed!\\n\\n 1.

One last thing we can do on the Storage Account is **enable backups** for your **Azure File Share** - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-afs?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-afs?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-afs?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796\\")\\n\\n### Configure File Share\\n\\nNow that the Microsoft Entra ID rights have been assigned and the File Share has been created, we now need to set up the NTFS permissions on the FSLogix share.\\n\\n 1. Navigate to **File Shares** _(under Data Storage)_\\n 2. **Click** on **your** file-**share**\\n 3. Click on **Properties**\\n 4. **Copy** the **URL**\\n 5. ![FSLogix - File Share](/uploads/storageaccount_fslogixprofiles.png \\"FSLogix - File Share\\")\\n 6. **Remove http** and replace the forward slashes with backslashes so it looks like this: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\fslogixprofileslgnz.file.core.windows.net\\\\\\\\fslogixprofiles\\n 7. **Using** a **user** that is a **member of** the \'**AVD Admins\'** group and can **log into** the **Azure Virtual Desktop** farm _(it\u2019s a good chance to test connectivity to the Storage account through the private endpoint from your Azure Virtual Desktop session host)_\\n 8. Open **Computer**\\n 9. Select the Computer Tab and select **Map network drive**\\n10. ![FSLogix - Mapped Drive](/uploads/computermappeddrive.png \\"FSLogix - Mapped Drive\\")\\n11. **Select a drive letter** that isn\'t in use and paste in the **UNC path** created earlier _(step 6)_.\\n12. ![FSLogix - Mapped Drive](/uploads/computermappingdrive.png \\"FSLogix - Mapped Drive\\")\\n13. Hopefully, you should **successfully** have **mapped** a **drive**!\\n14. Once the drive is mapped, **open** up a **Command Prompt**\\n\\n    _Note: Don\'t run the Command Prompt as Administrator, as this runs in a separate context and doesn\'t have permissions to the mapped drive._\\n15. **Run** the **following command** to **set** the necessary **NTFS permissions** _(change the Drive mapping and AVD Users group to your own group)_:\\n\\n        icacls z: /grant \\"AVD Users\\":(M)\\n        \\n        icacls z: /grant \\"Creator Owner\\":(OI)(CI)(IO)(M)\\n        \\n        icacls z: /remove \\"Authenticated Users\\"\\n        \\n        icacls z: /remove \\"Builtin\\\\Users\\"\\n16. ![FSLogix - Security Permissions](/uploads/setfslogixpermissions.png \\"FSLogix - Security Permissions\\")\\n17. The permissions should look similar to:\\n18. ![FSLogix - Security Permissions](/uploads/setfslogixpermissions2.png \\"FSLogix - Security Permissions\\")\\n\\n### Configure FSLogix policies\\n\\nNow that you have successfully created a Storage Account and granted it the proper permissions, we now need to configure Group Policy for FSLogix.\\n\\n 1. **Connect to** your Microsoft Entra ID **Utility server**, that has **Group Policy management** installed using an account in the: AAD DC Administrators group\\n 2. **Download** the latest **FSLogix Agent** - [https://aka.ms/fslogix_download](https://aka.ms/fslogix_download \\"https://aka.ms/fslogix_download?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796\\") onto the Utility server\\n 3. **Extract** the FSLogix agent **zip** file to a folder\\n 4. Now we will **create** a **Central Store** to manage the Group Policy consistently\\n 5. On your Utility server, browse to **C:\\\\\\\\Windows** _(If you are primarily using Azure Virtual Desktop, it may be best to copy the PolicyDefinitions folder from an Azure Virtual Desktop session host to make sure you can edit all the latest Windows 10 policies)_\\n 6. **Copy** the **PolicyDefinitions** folder\\n 7. Copy **the PolicyDefinitions** folder to your **Policies** folder on your **domain**: \\\\\\\\luke.geek.nz\\\\\\\\SYSVOL\\\\\\\\luke.geek.nz\\\\\\\\Policies\\\\\\n  _(replace luke.geek.nz, with your ADDS DNS name)_\\n 8. ![FSLogix - Group Policy](/uploads/sysvolpolicies.png \\"FSLogix - Group Policy\\")\\n 9. **Go to** your **extracted** FSLogix **folder** and **copy**:\\n    * fslogix.admx to: \\\\\\\\luke.geek.nz\\\\\\\\SYSVOL\\\\\\\\luke.geek.nz\\\\\\\\Policies\\\\\\\\PolicyDefinitions\\\\\\n    * fslogix.adml to: \\\\\\\\luke.geek.nz\\\\\\\\SYSVOL\\\\\\\\luke.geek.nz\\\\\\\\Policies\\\\\\\\PolicyDefinitions\\\\\\\\en-US\\\\\\n10. This will allow us to use Group Policy to manage FSLogix using Group Policy, **Open Group Policy Management**\\n11. **Navigate** to your **Hosts OU**\\n12. Right-click the OU and select: **Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here\u2026**\\n13. Name it according to your naming standards (this is a Computer-based policy) - in my example, I am using: AVD_ComputerPolicy\\n14. Click **Ok**\\n15. ![FSLogix - Group Policy](/uploads/gpo_management_createpolicy.png \\"FSLogix - Group Policy\\")\\n16. Right-click the GPO you have just created and select **Edit\u2026**\\n17. Because this is a Computer-based policy, to speed up processing, **right-click** the **Policy heading** and select **Properties**\\n18. Tick: **Disable User Configuration Settings**\\n19. Confirm that you want to do it and select **Yes**\\n20. Click **Apply**\\n21. While you have the screen open, **click on** **Comment**, and **add** in some **details** about the GPO for future reference then click **Apply** and **Ok**\\n22. ![FSLogix - Group Policy](/uploads/gpo_avd_computerpolicy.png \\"FSLogix - Group Policy\\")\\n23. Now it\'s time to actually configure the FSLogix Group Policy settings.\\n24. **Navigate** to: Computer Configuration\\\\\\\\Policies\\\\\\\\Administrative Templates\\\\\\\\FSLogix\\\\\\\\**Profile Containers**\\n25. Open up **Enabled** and select: **Enabled** and **Apply**\\n26. Open: **VHD Location** and **copy** in your Profiles **UNC share** _(for example, mine is:_ \\\\[_\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\fslogixprofileslgnz.file.core.windows.net\\\\\\\\fslogixprofiles)_ click **Ok**\\n27. Select: **Delete local profile when FSLofix profile should apply**, click **Enabled** and check to **Delete local profile when FSLogix Profile should apply** _(don\'t blindly follow this, I am making the assumption this is a new farm, with no user-based profile stored on it. You may need to create a separate GPO to test this setting on, or you could lose valuable data)_.\\n28. Open: **Set Outlook cached mode on successful container attach** to **Enabled**.\\n29. Now in Group Policy Management console, click on **Container and Directory Naming** and select **Virtual Disk type**\\n30. Click **Enabled** and change the Option to **VHDX**, click **Ok**\\n31. Click on: **Swap directory name components setting** and click **Enabled**, **check** the s**wap directory name components** and click **Apply**\\n32. **Restart** the Azure Virtual Desktop **session hosts** to pick up the new policies.\\n33. **You have now set up FSLogix profiles!

Log in to the **Azure Portal**\\n 2. Click on **Create a resource**\\n 3. Search for: **Azure AD Domain Services**. You can change the Publisher Type to Microsoft, so it doesn\'t display any other marketplace offerings.\\n    ![Azure AD Domain - Marketplace](/uploads/azureaddssearch.png \\"Azure AD Domain - Marketplace\\")\\n    ![Azure AD Domain - Marketplace](/uploads/azureaddsmarketplace.png \\"Azure AD Domain - Marketplace\\")\\n 4. Click **Create**\\n 5. If you already have a **Resource Group**, select it - in this Demo, we are going to create one: aad_prod\\n 6. Type in the **DNS** domain **name** - this is the **FQDN** of your **domain**; in my demo, I will choose internal.luke.geek.nz.\\n 7. Because I am in New Zealand, the closest region to me is Australia East, so that\u2019s the region I will select. Make sure you **select** the **appropriate region** for where your Azure Virtual Desktop workloads are.\\n 8. **Select** the **SKU** and **Resource Type**; you can see the Pricing Calculator and the \\"Help Me choose..\\" links to verify your SKU and Forest type _(however, in most cases, such as Azure Virtual Desktop, your Forest Type will be \'User\')_.\\n    ![Azure AD Domain Services - Basic Config](/uploads/adds_basics.png \\"Azure AD Domain Services - Basic Config\\")\\n 9. Click **Next**\\n10. We will set up the **Networking**; if you have an already existing Virtual Network, select it.\\n    _Azure AD Domain Services uses a dedicated subnet within a virtual network to hold all of its resources. If using an existing network, ensure that the network configuration does not block the ports required for Azure AD Domain Services to run._ [_Learn more_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n11. I will let it create a **Virtual Network** and its Subnet (/24); click **Next**.\\n    ![Azure AD Domain Services - Networking Config](/uploads/adds_networking.png \\"Azure AD Domain Services - Networking Config\\")\\n12. **Azure AD Domain Services** will **create** a new Azure AD **Group** called: **AAD DC Administrators** - this group will be used for Administrator level permissions on the Azure AD Domain Services domain _(it automatically adds the account you are using to create Azure AD Domain Services into this group)_.\\n13. You can **configure Membership** of this **group** now and configure who gets alerted if there are issues with Azure AD Domain Services.\\n14. When you are ready, select **Next**.\\n    ![Azure AD Domain Services - Administration Config](/uploads/adds_admin.png \\"Azure AD Domain Services - Administration Config\\")\\n15. Depending on the amount of Microsoft Entra ID users you have in your organisation, and whether they will need Azure AD Domain Services, you can choose to synchronise **ALL Azure AD Groups and Users**, or specific groups of users _(this can be changed later)_, because my Azure AD Organisation is fairly low, I am going to Sync everything, click **Next**.\\n16. One thing to note here is the recommendation on the number of Objects _(Users, Groups)_ that will get synced to Azure AD Domain Services; for the Standard SKU, the suggested Object Count is 0 to 25,000 - for the Enterprise SKU, it is 25,000 to 100,000. So although there is no hard limit, it might be worth upgrading the SKU you are running for the additional backups and authentication if fit in the Enterprise space.\\n    ![Azure AD Domain Services - Syncronisation Config](/uploads/adds_sync.png \\"Azure AD Domain Services - Syncronisation Config\\")\\n17. We can now **configure** the **Security Setting**s, the only setting I am going to change here is **TLS 1.2 Only Mode** to **Enable**\\n    ![Azure AD Domain Services - Security Config](/uploads/adds_securitysettings.png \\"Azure AD Domain Services - Security Config\\")\\n18. Enter any applicable Tags and click **Review & Create** to **validate** your **configuration**.\\n19. Review your configuration, and if you are happy with it: Select **Create**.\\n20. Confirm that you are happy with the following and click **Ok**\\n    ![Azure AD Domain Services](/uploads/adds_youshouldknow.png \\"Azure AD Domain Services\\")\\n    **Note: Azure AD Domain Services can take up to an hour to provision.**\\n21. Once your Azure AD Domain Services has been configured, we must make some final configuration changes to point the Virtual Network DNS to use the Azure AD Domain Services. So first, **open** your newly created **Azure AD Domain Services**.\\n22. Click on **Overview** and: **Configuration** issues for your managed domain were detected. **Run configuration Diagnostics**\\n    ![Azure AD Domain Services](/uploads/adds_configissues.png \\"Azure AD Domain Services\\")\\n23. Click on **Run**\\n24. It should find a DNS record issue; click **Fix** to **set** the **DNS settings** of the Virtual Network to use the Azure AD Domain Services.\\n    Please **be careful here**, especially if you have already existing DNS settings; you might have to add it manually.\\n\\n## Create a Utility server to help Administer Azure Virtual Desktop\\n\\nWe need to create a Virtual Machine to help manage the AAD Domain and deploy Group Policies to help manage and configure the Azure Virtual Desktop farm.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the **Azure Portal**\\n 2. Click on **Create a resource.**\\n 3. Search for: **Windows Server 2019 Datacenter** and select **Create**\\n 4. If you already have a **Resource Group**, select it - in this Demo, we are going to create one: aad_infra\\n 5. **Specify** a **name** for the **Virtual Machine** _(I am going to use: UTILITY-P01)_\\n 6. **Select** a **Region** _(use the same Region as the Azure AD Domain Services and Azure Virtual Desktop resources)_\\n 7. For the **Image**, you can select either Windows Server 2019 Datacenter -Gen 1 or **Gen 2**; in my case, I am going with Gen2 _(although it doesn\'t matter)_.\\n 8. I am a firm believer in **selecting** the **smallest size** possible for the size, then scaling up when/where needed; I am going to go with a Standard_B2ms.\\n    ![Azure - Create VM](/uploads/createvm1.png \\"Azure - Create VM\\")\\n 9. Now we need to enter in the **Administrator** (local account) **Username** and **Password**.\\n10. Select \'**None**\' for **Public** inbound **ports**\\n11. If you have existing Windows Server licenses, you can select Hybrid Use Benefit; if not, select **Next: Disks**.\\n    ![Azure - Create VM](/uploads/createvm2.png \\"Azure - Create VM\\")\\n12. For the disks, I only need the OS disk, so I don\'t need to add a Data Disk _(although you could use this to store your Application install files etc.)_; however, to reduce cost, I am going to change the **Disk type** to **Standard SSD** _(locally-redundant storage)_ and select **Next: Networking**.\\n    ![Azure - Create VM](/uploads/createvmdisks.png \\"Azure - Create VM\\")\\n13. For the Virtual Network, make sure you **select** the **same** Virtual **Network** that the **Azure AD Domain Services** has been **installed to**; I will select the: aadds-subnet created earlier for my Utility server.\\n14. Set \'**None**\' for the **Public IP** and select **Next: Management**\\n    ![Azure - Create VM](/uploads/createvmnetworkinterface.png \\"Azure - Create VM\\")\\n15. Feel free to **leave** this all **as Default**\\n16. Just **be wary** of the **Auto-shutdown** settings, which will automatically shut down the VM daily _(I will keep mine selected as this is just a demo, and I only need the UTILITY server for initial configuration, it doesn\'t need to be running 24.7)_.\\n17. If you have a **Recovery Services Vault**, now is a good time to **add** the Utility **server** to **Backups**, so you don\'t forget it later, select Review & Create\\n18. **Verify** the **configuration** is correct and select **Create**\\n\\n## Create Azure Bastion to connect to the Utility server\\n\\nOnce the VM has been created, we now need to connect to it securely, so we will create a Bastion instance, which will allow us to connect to it without publishing the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) over the internet.\\n\\n 1. Log in to the **Azure Portal**\\n 2. Click on **Create a resource**\\n 3. Search for: **Bastion**\\n    ![Azure - Bastion](/uploads/bastionmarketplace.png \\"Azure - Bastion\\")\\n 4. Click **Create**\\n 5. This is a Networking resource to place it in the same Resource Group as my Virtual Network.\\n 6. Please type in a **Name** for the **Bastion** instance; I will call mine: Bastion\\n 7. **Select** the **Region** that **matches** the Virtual **Network** region\\n 8. Select the **Virtual Network**\\n 9. It now warns you about creating an: AzureBastionSubnet with a prefix of at least /27, so we need to create one; click on **Manage Subnet Configuration**.\\n10. Click **+ Subnet**\\n11. For the Name type in: **AzureBastionSubnet**\\n12. For the **Subnet** address range: **10.0.1.0/27**\\n    _If you get an error that indicates the address is overlapping with the aadds-subnet, it may be because the Address space is only a /24; click Cancel and click on Address Space in the Virtual Network and change the /24 to/16 to increase the address range._\\n13. Click **Save** to create the subnet\\n    ![Azure - Bastion](/uploads/az_subnet.png \\"Azure - Bastion\\")\\n14. Up the Top, click **Create a Bastion**. To go back to the Bastion setup, your Subnet should be selected automatically.\\n15. You do need a **Public IP** for Bastion, so **confirm** the **name** is appropriate, then click **Review + Create**\\n    ![Azure - Bastion](/uploads/bastionsetup.png \\"Azure - Bastion\\")\\n16. Click on **Create** to create your Bastion instance!\\n\\n**Note: Bastion may take 10-20 minutes to provision.**\\n\\n## Configure the Utility server\\n\\nNow that we have a Bastion instance, it is time to connect and configure the Utility server and create a new Azure AD user for Azure Virtual Desktop configuration.\\n\\n 1. First thing I am going to create a separate Azure AD account to manage the Utility server and join the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts to the domain; this is to separate my own account. Azure AD Domain Services relies on password hash. So you won\'t be able to log in using Azure AD Domain Services unless you and the people using it have reset their passwords AFTER Azure AD Domain Services has been created.\\n 2. Navigate to the Azure Portal and open **Microsoft Entra ID**\\n 3. Click on **Users**\\n 4. Click on **+ New User**\\n 5. **Type** in the **username** of a **user**, I am going to use: \'avdjoin\'\\n 6. Type in an **easily identifiable name**\\n 7. Generate or put in a secure **password**\\n 8. **Add** to the **AAD DC Administrators** group\\n 9. Click **Ok** to create the user\\n    ![Azure AD - Users](/uploads/avdjoin.png \\"Azure AD - Users\\")\\n10. Once the account has been created, make sure to **login** with it **to** the **Azure Portal** or Office portal to **force** a final **password reset**, or you won\'t be able to use it in the next steps as it will be waiting for a password reset.\\n11. Once that account has been created, it\'s time to **join** your utility **server** to the Microsoft Entra ID **Domain**, navigate to your Utility **server** and click **Connect**.\\n12. Select **Bastion**\\n13. Select **Use Bastion**\\n14. **Type** in the **username** and **password** of the **LOCAL account** created when the Virtual Machine was created and click **Connect**\\n    _Note: If you are running a popup blocker, you need to allow it to open, as Bastion opens up the connection in a new window._\\n    ![Azure Bastion](/uploads/azurebastionconnect.png \\"Azure Bastion\\")\\n15. You should now be logged in to the server successfully.\\n16. Now it\'s time to join the server to the domain _(make sure that DNS is configured for AD Domain Services on the Virtual Network, see the last step in the AD Domain Services section, or you won\'t be able to domain join anything)_.\\n17. In **Server Management**, click on **Local Server**\\n18. Select **WORKGROUP**\\n19. Click **Change\u2026**\\n20. Select **Domain**\\n21. Please **type** in the DNS name of your **domain**; in my demo, it is: luke.geek.nz\\n22. **Type** in the **username** and **password** of the account we created earlier and clicked **Ok**\\n    ![Azure - Domain Join](/uploads/jointodomain.png \\"Azure - Domain Join\\")\\n23. Once you see, Welcome to the domain, click **Ok** a few times to **restart** the **server**.\\n24. Once the server has been restarted, you can now close your **bastion** window and **reconnect** using your **Azure AD** credentials (in my case, avdjoin), a **member** of the **ADDC Administrators group**.\\n    ![Azure - Connect to Bastion](/uploads/azurebastionconnect2.png \\"Azure - Connect to Bastion\\")\\n25. You have now successfully connected using an Azure AD account to the AD Services domain.\\n26. Now it\'s time to install some base Active Directory tools\\n27. Open Windows **PowerShell** as **Administrator**\\n28. **Type** in the following PowerShell **commands**:\\n\\n        Add-WindowsFeature RSAT-Role-Tools\\n        \\n        Install-WindowsFeature \u2013Name GPMC\\n\\n_Note: You can use the little arrows on the left-hand side of your Remote Desktop window to copy and paste text to and from your Bastion connection._\\n\\n1. This will now install the base Active Directory remote management tools, including Group Policy Management, so you can now create and manage the Group Policy objects for your Azure Virtual Desktop hosts.\\n   ![Server Tools](/uploads/utility_servertools.png)\\n2. We will now set up some base configurations to **create** a custom **OU** for the Azure Virtual Desktops **hosts** to go into:\\n\\n* Open **Active Directory Users & Computers**\\n* **Expand** out the **Domain** and right-click (at the Top Level)\\n* Select **New, Organisational Unit**\\n\\n![Server Tools](/uploads/utility_newou.png)\\n\\n* Type in: AVD\\n* In the AVD OU, **create** a new **OU** called: Hosts\\n* Now that we have an OU for the hosts, we will need to tell Azure what OU the hosts go into, so while we have Active Directory Users and Computers open, click on View.\\n* Select **Advanced Features**\\n* **Right-click** the Hosts **OU**\\n* Select **Properties**\\n* Click on **Attribute Editor**\\n* Find the **distinguishedName attribute**\\n\\n![Server Tools](/uploads/utility_serverdn.png)\\n\\n* Open and **Copy** the **Value** for future _(in my case: OU=Hosts,OU=AVD,DC=luke,DC=geek,DC=nz)_ for future reference.\\n* Now that we have the AVD Hosts OU, you can also open Group Policy Management and create your Computer policies.\\n\\n## Deploy Azure Virtual Desktop\\n\\nNow we are ready to deploy Azure Virtual Desktop finally!\\n\\n 1. Log in to the **Azure Portal**\\n 2. Click on **Create a resource**\\n 3.

This way, the system can conserve resources.\\n\\nThe downside is that the response to the first request after the web app is unloaded is longer, as the Web App has to load into memory and present itself, which could lead to a bad user experience.\\n\\nTo ensure that the Azure App Service Web App is running and always available to respond to incoming HTTP(S) requests, can be set the \\"Always On\\" configuration feature to \\"On\\".\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nBy setting the \\"Always On\\" feature of the App Service Web App to \u201cOn\u201d, will ensure that Azure will always keep an instance of the Web App running at all times. This way when a user/client hits the Azure Front Door endpoint, the back-end Web App will always be ready to respond to that request without timing out. This will ensure the application is always available even during times of low usage or inactivity. Azure will continuously ping the website to keep the website alive.\\n\\nEnabling \\"Always On\\" keeps your Apps always loaded, even when there is no traffic. It\u2019s required for example when using continuous Web Jobs or for Web Jobs that are triggered using a [CRON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron \\"Wikipedia - cron\\") expression, this feature is similar to the Internet Information Services (IIS) idle time-out property.\\n\\nDisabling \\"Always On\\" makes your Apps unloaded if they are idle for a set period of time. This way, the system can conserve resources. This is the reason \u201cAlways On\u201d is set as disabled by default.\\n\\nYou need a minimum of Basic and Standard App Service Tiers to enable \\"Always On\\"\\n\\nHaving \\"Always On\\" off or on does not affect your billing or pricing, the Azure App Service billing is done at the App Service Plan level, which is charged per hour that the App Service Plan exists and is running, this is charged whether you have a WebApp or its set to \\"Always On\\" or not.\\n\\n## Configure Always On\\n\\nNote: Any changes to applications settings and connection strings could restart your application, so make sure that you schedule this during a period you can have an intermittent outage.\\n\\n1.

Click on \u2018Add Custom Domain\u2019.\\n 5. type in your custom domain _(in my example, I am using a domain I own called: badasscloud.com)_\\n 6. Select Validate; you will have a similar seen to me below; select CNAME.\\n![Azure - Add Custom Domain](/uploads/AzureAppService_AddCustomDomain.png \\"Azure - Add Custom Domain\\")\\n 7. Now we need to validate that you are the one who owns the domains and can use it for your WebApp, so we will need to create some records to verify that you own the domain and redirect the website to the Azure Websites.\\n 8. Login to Cloudflare\\n 9. Select SSL/TLS and make sure that \u2018Flexible\u2019 SSL has been selected.\\n10. Select DNS \\n_Note: You may need to remove any A records for \u2018www\u2019 or the root domain \u2018@\u2019 you have set; please make sure you have a reference to them in case you need to roll back any changes because we will be redirecting the main URL to an Azure DNS alias, we will be using Cloudflare CNAME flattening at the root level, so anyone going to \u2018badasscloud.com\u2019 will be redirected to the Azure WebApp._\\n11. You can also use the txt record to validate the domain and do some reconfiguration without changing the domain and redirecting traffic ahead of your change to avoid downtime.\\n12. Add in the records to Cloudflare (please note that verification will fail if Cloudflare proxy is turned on, so make sure that the proxy status is set to DNS only)\\n![](/uploads/badassclouddns_azureverification.png)\\n13.

If they are still Red, wait a few minutes for Cloudflare to replicate the changes across its Networks and Azure to clear any server-side caching, verification can fail if you try to verify straight away.\\n18. Now that Domain verification has been completed navigate Cloudflare and enable the Cloudflare proxy for your root domain and www record. ![](/uploads/badassclouddns_postazureverification.png)\\n19. Navigate and test your website. Now that the domain has been added to the Azure WebApp and Cloudflare proxy has been enabled, your website will now have a certificate supplied by Cloudflare. You have now set up Flexible SSL traffic to your website, so traffic between users\u2019 browsers to Cloudflare is now encrypted. ![badasscloud.com - Cloudflare Certificate](/uploads/badasscloud_Azure_Cloudflarefront.png \\"badasscloud.com - Cloudflare Certificate\\")\\n\\n## **Update your WebApp to support \u2018Full\u2019 end-to-end using Cloudflare origin certificate**\\n\\nAdding your domain to Cloudflare was only the first part of the puzzle; although traffic between the browser and Cloudflare is now encrypted, traffic between Cloudflare and your WebApp is not; to encrypt this traffic, we are going to use the Cloudflare origin certificate.\\n\\nCloudflare Origin Certificates are free SSL certificates issued by Cloudflare for installation on your origin server to facilitate end-to-end encryption for your visitors using HTTPS. Once deployed, they are [compatible with the Strict SSL mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes#strict). By default, newly generated certificates are valid for 15 years, but you can change this to 7 days.\\n\\n 1. Log in to Cloudflare\\n 2. Click on SSL/TLS\\n 3. Click on Origin Server\\n 4. Click on Create Certificate ![Cloudflare - Origin Certificate](/uploads/Cloudflare_OriginCert1.png \\"Cloudflare - Origin Certificate\\")\\n 5. Verify that the Private Key Type is RSA (2048)\\n 6. Make sure that the Hostnames you want to be covered under the origin cert is covered.\\n 7. Verify certificate validity, in my example, and I am going with 15 years; remember to keep this certificate validated and updated. ![Cloudflare - Origin Certificate](/uploads/Cloudflare_OriginCert2.png \\"Cloudflare - Origin Certificate\\")\\n 8. Click Create\\n 9. Cloudflare will now generate your Origin certificate and Private key (save these somewhere secure, the private key will not be shown again).\\n10. Now we need to create a certificate PFX file to upload to the Azure WebApp, run PfxCreator.exe (see Prerequisites for download link)\\n11. Paste the Origin Certificate into the: Certificate (PEM)\\n12. Paste the Private Key into the Private Key (PEM) ![PfxCreator](/uploads/PfxCreator.png \\"PfxCreator\\")\\n13. Type in a password for the certificate\\n14. Click Save PFX\u2026 and save your certificate.\\n15. Login into the Azure Portal\\n16. Navigate to your App Service.\\n17. Underneath Settings on the left-hand side blade of the App Settings, look for Custom Domains and select it.\\n18. You should see the SSL state of your domain as \u2018Not Secure\u2019, and under SSL Binding, you will have an option to Add Binding, click on Add Binding.\\n19. Select your Custom Domain and click Upload PFX Certificate\\n20. Click File and browse for your certificate.\\n21. Type in the password you entered PFXCreator earlier. ![Azure Portal - Add Private Certificate](/uploads/AzureWebApp-Cloudflare_OriginCert_AddBinding1.png.png \\"Azure Portal - Add Private Certificate\\")\\n22.

This support provides Linux file system compatibility at object storage scale and prices and enables Linux clients to [mount a container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/network-file-system-protocol-support?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Network File System (NFS) 3.0 protocol support in Azure Blob storage (preview)\\") in Blob storage from an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) or a computer on-premises.\\n\\n# First up what is a Blob?\\n\\nBlobs - _\u201cHighly scalable, REST-based cloud object store\u201d_\\n\\n* Data sharing, Big Data, Backups\\n* Block Blobs: Read and write data in blocks. Optimized for sequential IO. Most cost-effective Storage. Ideal for files, documents & media.\\n* Page Blobs: Optimized for random access and can be up to 8 TB in size. IaaS VM OS & data disks and backups are of this type.\\n* Append Blobs: Like block blobs and optimized for append operations. Ideal for logging scenarios and total size can be up to 195 GB.\\n\\n# Aren\u2019t there only 2 access tiers?\\n\\nWhen you create an Azure Storage account, you get presented with 2 options for the Access Tier:\\n\\n* Hot\\n* Cool\\n\\n**Hot access tier**\\n\\nThe hot access tier has higher storage costs than cool and archive tiers, but the lowest access costs. Example usage scenarios for the hot access tier include:\\n\\n* Data that is in active use or is expected to be read from and written to frequently.\\n* Data that is staged for processing and eventual migration to the cool access tier\\n\\n**Cool access tier**\\n\\nThe cool access tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to hot storage. This tier is intended for data that will remain in the cool tier for at least 30 days. Example usage scenarios for the cool access tier include:\\n\\n* Short-term backup and disaster recovery\\n* Older data not used frequently but expected to be available immediately when accessed.\\n* Large data sets need to be stored cost-effectively, while more data is being gathered for future processing.\\n\\nThese options are set globally for your Azure Storage account blobs, however, there is a third tier, the Archive Access Tier:\\n\\n**Archive access tier**\\n\\nThe Archive access tier has the lowest storage cost, but higher data retrieval costs compared to hot and cool tiers.\\n\\nData must remain in the archive tier for at least 180 days or be subject to an early deletion charge. Data in the archive tier can take several hours to retrieve depending on the specified rehydration priority.\\n\\nWhile a blob is in archive storage, the blob data is offline and cannot be read or modified. To read or download a blob in the archive, you must first rehydrate it to an online tier.\\n\\n# How is this charged?\\n\\nDepending on which tier your data is in, depends on the costs, Azure Blob Storage is charged on Read/Write and list operation and other factors, for example:\\n\\n* Hot Tier: Lower access prices for frequent use\\n* Cool Tier: Lower storage prices for high volume\\n* The volume of data stored per month.\\n* Quantity and types of operations performed, along with any data transfer costs.\\n* Data redundancy option selected.\\n\\nMore information here: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/blobs/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/blobs/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"Azure Blobs\\")\\n\\n# What is data lifecycle management?\\n\\nThere are many versions of it, but at its core, there are 5 stages to simple data lifecycle management:\\n\\n* **Creation** \u2013 When the data is first created.\\n* **Storage** -Where the data is stored.\\n* **Usage** \u2013 When the data is useful and relevant and used.\\n* **Archival** \u2013 When the data is not as useful, but still helpful to have around due to knowledge or legal requirements.\\n* **Destruction** \u2013 When the data is completely irrelevant and there is no need to store or use it anymore.\\n\\n# Right... so, tell me more about the Azure Blob Lifecycle Management?\\n\\nAzure Blob Storage has a lifecycle management feature built-in. Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management offers a rich, rule-based policy for General Purpose v2 and blob (and Premium Block blob) storage accounts.\\n\\n* Imagine you working on a project, such as purchasing a new company you not only want somewhere to store that data, but you want to make sure it is accessible quickly, so you put it in an Azure Blob Storage account under the Hot Tier.\\n* You\u2019ve then spent some time working on new documents using the data you acquired when you purchased the \u2018new\u2019 company, but don\u2019t touch them anymore, you don\u2019t want them sitting on fast storage costing you additional money, so they get migrated to a \u2018Cool\u2019 access tier.\\n* A few months later, you realized that you needed some of the original data from the company acquisition, you find the files and use them, it took a bit longer to open as the data needed to be migrated to the \u2018hot tier\u2019 but you are happy because the data that you want was there.\\n* A year later, you are onto acquiring another company and the data from the company acquisition which seemed a lifetime ago is forgotten about, however, you know you might need it for legal or finance auditing purposes, the data goes into the Archive tier, costing you less than the cool tier, but could be reacquired at a later date if needed (for an extra charge).\\n* 7 years down the track, you\u2019re now a multi-million-dollar firm, and have completely forgotten or no longer need the data from your original acquisition, the data then gets deleted, saving you money and data management costs.\\n\\nMicrosoft Azure and Lifecycle Management for Blob Storage automate the entire lifecycle for you.\\n\\n# How do I enable or configure Azure Blob Lifecycle Management?\\n\\n1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home \\"Azure Portal\\")\\n2. Find the Azure storage account you want to configure Lifecycle Management on\\n3. On the Storage account left-hand side Blade, under Blob Service click on Lifecycle Management\\n4. Click on Add a rule\\n5. Enter in a Rule name any name that suits your naming standards, for example, AzureBlobLifecyclePolicy.\\n![Azure Blob Lifecycle Policy](/uploads/azurebaseblobrules1.png \\"Azure Blob Lifecycle Policy\\")\\n_Note: Make sure Append Blobs is unselected, this is un-supported for moving access tiers (however supports being deleted after x amount of days)._\\n 6. Click Next\\n 7. This is where the magic happens, we are going to go with the following:\\n    ![Azure Base Blob Policies](/uploads/azurebaseblobrules.png \\"Azure Base Blob Policies\\")\\n 8. Base Blobs that were last modified 90 days ago will be moved to Cool storage.\\n 9. Click on + Add if-then block, now we will select the Archive Storage, the example we will now archive data that has been in Cool storage for 90 days, so we enter in: 180 days.\\n    _Note: Migrating the data between Access Tiers, does not change the last modified date of the file, so it\'s 90 days for migrating to Cool, then another 90 days to move to archive._\\n10. Click on + Add if-then block, now we will select the Delete the blob, data that has been in Archive storage for 90 days will now be deleted, so we enter in: 270 days.\\n11. Click Next and do the same for Snapshots and versions and click Save.\\n12. Congratulations, you have now created an Azure Blob Lifecycle policy!\\n\\nOnce the Policy has been saved, it is Enabled by default.

Example below:\\n\\n    {\\n        \\"recommendationTypeId\\": \\"7262dc51-c168-41b5-b99b-b5b98f8fe50a\\",\\n        \\"extendedProperties\\": {\\n            \\"assessmentKey\\": \\"7262dc51-c168-41b5-b99b-b5b98f8fe50a\\",\\n            \\"score\\": \\"0\\"\\n        },\\n        \\"resourceMetadata\\": {\\n            \\"resourceId\\": \\"/subscriptions/0673a0bd-0c9b-483f-9aee-c44795ae739f\\",\\n            \\"singular\\": null,\\n            \\"plural\\": null,\\n            \\"action\\": null,\\n            \\"source\\": \\"/subscriptions/0673a0bd-0c9b-483f-9aee-c44795ae739f/providers/Microsoft.Security/assessments/7262dc51-c168-41b5-b99b-b5b98f8fe50a\\"\\n        },\\n        \\"shortDescription\\": {\\n            \\"solution\\": \\"Subscriptions should have a contact email address for security issues\\",\\n            \\"problem\\": \\"Subscriptions should have a contact email address for security issues\\"\\n        },\\n        \\"suppressionIds\\": null,\\n        \\"impactedField\\": \\"Microsoft.Subscriptions/subscriptions\\",\\n        \\"impactedValue\\": \\"0673a0bd-0c9b-483f-9aee-c44795ae739f\\",\\n        \\"lastUpdated\\": \\"2021-04-08T13:15:54.2870000Z\\",\\n        \\"category\\": \\"Security\\",\\n        \\"metadata\\": null,\\n        \\"impact\\": \\"Low\\"\\n    }\\n\\nAnd no, that isn\'t my real Subscription ID etc, I\'ve replaced the field with randomly generated GUIDs.\\n\\nWe can see that there is a good amount of actionable data here such as:\\n\\n* This is a Security Category recommendation\\n* It is Low Impact\\n* The problem is that the Azure subscription should have a contact email address to be used for Security alerts and it does not have one set up (Oops!)\\n\\nSo we need to turn it into something a bit more useable, I know that the Azure Advisor has the following categories:\\n\\n* Cost\\n* HighAvailability\\n* OperationalExcellence\\n* Performance\\n* Security\\n\\nThe same syntax can be used for any of these categories, for my example, we will continue with Security, Looking at the Details (or Example above) we can see that Category is simply listed on its own at the top level, inside the \'microsoft.advisor/recommendations\' field, so we now need to add another pipe to the query:\\n\\n    | where properties[\'category\'] == \'Security\'\\n\\nThis will now only select the \'Security\' category. However as you can see below, it\'s hardly something you can action on or read.\\n\\n![Azure Resource Graph - Category \'Security\'](/uploads/azureresourcegraph_category.png \\"Azure Resource Graph - Category \'Security\'\\")\\n\\nThe next step is to look into making it a bit more readable because we know this is a Kusto Language, its time to hit the Microsoft Docs page and read up about the \'Project Operator\' - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectoperator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectoperator \\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/projectoperator?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796\\"). Project = \\"Select the columns to include, rename or drop, and insert new computed columns.\\" That sounds like what we want.\\n\\nIf we take a gander back at the \'Full Details\' (or Example above) there are 3 fields I am looking at that would add the most value to a report or digest for the security posture of my Azure ecosystem:\\n\\n* Solution\\n* impactedField\\n* impactedValue\\n\\nWe now need to add our final pipe to remove everything we don\'t want and add the properties that make the most sense to use, because we are using multiple properties we will do it separated by commas. It\'s worth noting that unlike the \'Security\' property above (and the impactedField, impactedValue), which was a top-level property, the Solution property is a sub-properties of \'shortDescription\', so we have to select the shortdescription property and then expand out to the extended solution property like below:\\n\\n    | project properties.shortDescription.solution\\n\\nThat now gives us a list of the security alerts on the subscription, but without a heading that makes sense:\\n\\n![Azure Resource Graph](/uploads/azureresourcegraphheader.png)\\n\\nTo add a header called: Recommendation, we need to do the following\\n\\n    | project Recommendation=tostring(properties.shortDescription.solution)\\n\\nNow we are ready to add the impactedField and impactedValue.\\n\\nThe final query should look like this:\\n\\n    advisorresources\\n    | where type == \'microsoft.advisor/recommendations\'\\n    | where properties[\'category\'] == \'Security\'\\n    | project Recommendation=tostring(properties.shortDescription.solution), ImpactedType=tostring(properties.impactedField), ImpactedResources=tostring(properties.impactedValue )\\n\\nand the Azure Resource Graph Explorer should display something like this:\\n\\n![Azure Resource Graph](/uploads/azuregraphexplorerfinalquery.png)\\n\\nProtip, on the Azure Resource Graph Explorer page, click on \'Get Started\', underneath the Query window to view Example Queries, such as Listing all Public IP addresses or even getting the Security Center Recommendations. They are really good to use as a base and see how they work.\\n\\n### Azure Graph PowerShell\\n\\nUsing the Azure Resource Graph Explorer is a good way to create the Kusto queries you want, which you can then run the queries in PowerShell and turn them into PowerShell objects, which opens up a few possibilities for things like:\\n\\n* Automated Reporting on Cost, Security etc\\n* Proactive remediation actions.\\n\\nFirst things first you need to install the Az.ResourceGraph module, then you can use the Search-AzGraph to run the queries that you created above. I am going to rely on the gist below to give you a few examples.\\n\\n![Azure Resource Graph](/uploads/azuregraphpowershell.png)\\n\\n```powershell title=\\"AzGraph.ps1\\"\\n\\n   <#\\n      .SYNOPSIS\\n      Installs the Az.ResourceGraph Module and has example queries\\n      .NOTES\\n      Version:        1.0\\n      Author:         Luke Murray (Luke.Geek.NZ) \\n      Website:        https://luke.geek.nz/azure-resource-graph-explorer-and-the-powershell-azure-resource-graph\\n      Creation Date:  09.04.21\\n      Change History: \\n      09.04.21 - Intital script development\\n\\n  #>\\n  \\n  # Install the Resource Graph module from PowerShell Gallery\\nInstall-Module -Name Az.ResourceGraph -Scope CurrentUser\\n\\n# Imports the Resource Graph module into the PowerShell session\\nImport-Module -Name Az.ResourceGraph\\n\\n#Connects to Microsoft Azure\\nConnect-AzAccount\\n\\n#Grabs the acount of all recommendations under each Category that the Azure Advisor Has\\n\\nSearch-AzGraph -Query \\"advisorresources | summarize Count=count() by Category=tostring(properties.category) | where Category!=\'\' | sort by Category asc\\"\\n\\n#Following on from the Blog post, this is the query we created to list all Security recommendations, their resource type and what resources were impacted\\n\\nSearch-AzGraph -Query \\"advisorresources\\n| where type == \'microsoft.advisor/recommendations\'\\n| where properties[\'category\'] == \'Security\'\\n| project Recommendation=tostring(properties.shortDescription.solution), ImpactedType=tostring(properties.impactedField), ImpactedResources=tostring(properties.impactedValue )\\"\\n\\n#List of Performance recommendations\\n\\nSearch-AzGraph -Query \\"advisorresources | where type == \'microsoft.advisor/recommendations\' and properties.category == \'Performance\' | project Solution=tostring(properties.shortDescription.solution) | summarize Count=count() by Solution | sort by Count\\"\\n\\n#List of Cost recommendations\\n\\nSearch-AzGraph -Query \\"advisorresources | where type == \'microsoft.advisor/recommendations\' and properties.category == \'Cost\' | summarize Resources = dcount(tostring(properties.resourceMetadata.resourceId)), Savings = sum(todouble(properties.extendedProperties.savingsAmount)) by Solution = tostring(properties.shortDescription.solution), Currency = tostring(properties.extendedProperties.savingsCurrency) | project Solution, Resources, Savings = bin(Savings, 0.01), Currency | order by Savings desc\\"\\n\\n```"},{"id":"/2021/04/03/keep-up-to-date-with-latest-changes-on-azure-using-powershell","metadata":{"permalink":"/2021/04/03/keep-up-to-date-with-latest-changes-on-azure-using-powershell","source":"@site/blog/2021-04-03-keep-up-to-date-with-latest-changes-on-azure-using-powershell.md","title":"Keep up to date with Azure changes using PowerShell","description":"Keeping up with what is happening with changes and previews in Microsoft Azure is difficult, change happens all the time - and being able to stay informed on what is happening with the Azure ecosystem is half the battle, whether it is a new feature or security fix.","date":"2021-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Misc","permalink":"/tags/misc"},{"label":"PowerShell","permalink":"/tags/power-shell"},{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":2.68,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Keep up to date with Azure changes using PowerShell","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Misc","PowerShell","Azure"],"date":"2021-04-03 00:00:00 +1300","toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"images/powershell-blog-feature-banner.png"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Azure Resource Graph Explorer and the PowerShell Azure Resource Graph","permalink":"/2021/04/09/azure-resource-graph-explorer-and-the-powershell-azure-resource-graph"},"nextItem":{"title":"Microsoft Teams Recommendations","permalink":"/2021/03/30/microsoft-teams-recommendations"}},"content":"Keeping up with what is happening with changes and previews in Microsoft Azure is difficult, change happens all the time - and being able to stay informed on what is happening with the Azure ecosystem is half the battle, whether it is a new feature or security fix.\\n\\nMicrosoft publishes the latest updates on Azure Products and features to their Azure Updates blog: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/ \\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796\\")\\n\\nSo you can browse the website each week, or... monitor the RSS feeds.

These messages are generated from your tenant as they represent your default domain SMTP FQDN.Teams uses Microsoft Exchange Online as well to send notifications to team members when they\u2019ve been added. The difference being the domain FQDN of the SMTP message is \u201c@email.teams.microsoft.com\u201d and could be caught by spam filtering. Outlook considers message from Teams as an external sender which is subject to standard security features such as blocking images and certain content.\\nAllow the following User Agent Strings for Microsoft Teams within the EWS configuration|Teams users may not be able to access Teams meetings/connectors though their mailboxes are in Exchange Online.\\nAssign a valid security group that can be used for controlling who can create Office 365 groups as well as Office 365 services that depends on groups such as Teams, Planner, etc|A security group is configured to restrict which users are allowed to create groups. However this security group does not exist anymore which prevents the creation of new groups.\\nAssign Teams Meeting Room license to your Teams meeting room account |Without the proper license, you may have some Teams Meeting room features that are not working properly or not available such as the ability to dial-out attendees into your meeting.\\nAssociate registered SBC with Office domain|Check as part of the Direct Routing configuration is missing the domain name associated with one of your SBCs.\\nCheck  Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams meeting migration failures|Some of your user\u2019s meeting may not have been successfully migrated  from Skype for Business to Teams.  Users might be unable to join the affected meetings.\\nCheck Microsoft Stream license is assigned to users if cloud recording is allowed |Your users who can do Teams meeting and recordings may not have the necessary Microsoft Stream license to store /upload meeting recordings / playback to Microsoft Stream.\\nCheck the SBC gateway(s) associated with voice routes|Makse sure that none or more of your SBC gateway(s) defined in Voice Routes are in disabled state. This could cause unexpected call failures.\\nConfigure your Meeting Room accounts with the recommended setting of AddAdditionalResponse|Microsoft Teams Rooms will only work in a properly configured Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business environment where the device accounts are set up correctly.  To provide optimal meeting experience, you should configure your meeting room accounts meeting the recommendations.\\nConfigure your Meeting Room accounts with the recommended setting of AddOrganizerToSubject|Microsoft Teams Rooms will only work in a properly configured Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business environment where the device accounts are set up correctly.  To provide optimal meeting experience, you should configure your meeting room accounts meeting the recommendations.\\nConfigure your Meeting Room accounts with the recommended setting of DeleteComments|Microsoft Teams Rooms will only work in a properly configured Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business environment where the device accounts are set up correctly.  To provide optimal meeting experience, you should configure your meeting room accounts meeting the recommendations.\\nConfigure your Meeting Room accounts with the recommended setting of RemovePrivateProperty|Microsoft Teams Rooms will only work in a properly configured Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business environment where the device accounts are set up correctly.  To provide optimal meeting experience, you should configure your meeting room accounts meeting the recommendations.\\nCreate meeting room lists for room mailboxes to allow for searching and booking rooms with Microsoft Teams |You need to create room list distribution group to be able to specify a meeting room when you schedule a Teams meeting.\\nCreate multiple Microsoft Teams IP Phone Policies to cater for the different phones and meeting rooms devices that you have in the organization |To provide more tailored user interfaces to different phones and meeting room devices that you\'ve, it is recommended to create different IP Phone policies to them.\\nCreate Office 365 Groups Classification|You can create classifications that the users in your organization can set when they create an Office 365 group. For example, you can allow users to set \\"Standard\\", \\"Secret\\", and \\"Top Secret\\" on groups they create. Group classifications aren\'t set by default and you need to create it in order for your users to set it. Use Microsoft Entra ID PowerShell to point your users to your organization\'s usage guidelines for Office 365 groups.\\nDefine Office 365 Group naming policy|To enforce consistent naming conventions for Office 365 groups created or edited by your users, set up a group naming policy for your tenants in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD). For example, you could use the naming policy to communicate the function of a group, membership, geographic region, or who created the group. You could also use the naming policy to help categorize groups in the address book. You can use the policy to block specific words from being used in group names and aliases.\\nEnable Advance Threat Protection for Teams|People regularly share files and collaborate using SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams. With Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), your organization can collaborate in a safer manner. ATP helps detect and block files that are identified as malicious in team sites and document libraries.\\nEnable connectors in your Exchange Online environment|When connectors are disabled in Exchange Online environment this is impacting connectors in Microsoft Teams. Users who are trying to add a connector in both Teams desktop client and a web app version will get the error: \u201cConnectors have been turned off for this mailbox by the admin. Contact your admin if you want to have connectors turned on: Access to Connectors is disabled.\u201d\\nEnable Teams license for some Office 365 Users |At the user level, access to Microsoft Teams can be enabled or disabled on a per-user basis by assigning or removing the Microsoft Teams product license. Once the license is disabled, the user access to Microsoft Teams will be prevented and the user will no longer be able to see Teams in the Office 365 app launcher and homepage. \\nEnable users SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Exchange Online|For the full Microsoft Teams experience, every user should be enabled for Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Office 365 Group creation.SharePoint Online is required to share and store files in team conversations. OneDrive for Business is required to share and store files in private chats. If users aren\'t assigned and enabled with SharePoint Online licenses, they don\'t have OneDrive for Business storage in Office 365. File sharing will continue to work in Channels, but users are unable to share files in Chats without OneDrive for Business storage in Office 365. In Microsoft Teams, security and compliance features like eDiscovery, Content Search, archiving, and legal hold work best in Exchange Online and SharePoint Online environments. For channel conversations, messages are journaled to the group mailbox in Exchange Online, where they\'re available for eDiscovery. If SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business (using work or school account) are enabled across the organization and for users, these compliance features are available for all files within Teams as well.\\nEnsure a public IP associated with FQDN of the SBCs|SBC needs to have valid public IP address to make it accessible from Internet by Teams Direct Routing components.\\nEnsure that the right ports and protocols are open across your network for optimum call experience|Skype for Business Online audio/video calls over TCP traffic do not perform as well as calls over UDP traffic.\\nGrant Teams Direct Routing users with appropriate Voice Routing Policy|List of users who are enabled for Teams DR/Hybrid Voice but not assigned with any OnlineVoiceRoutingPolicy\\nImplement Office 365 Groups governance|Office 365 Groups has a rich set of tools to implement any governance capabilities your organization might require.\\nImprove Network Performance for Skype for Business Online/Microsoft Teams |The quality of real-time media (audio, video, and application sharing) over IP is greatly impacted by the quality of end-to-end network connectivity. For optimal Skype for Business Online media quality, it is important for you to make sure there is a high-quality connection between your company network and Skype for Business Online. The best way to accomplish this is to set up your internal network and cloud connectivity based on the capacity of your network to accommodate for peak traffic volume for Skype for Business Online across all connections.\\nInfo: Teams which have external/guest users |You should review external users who had been invited to Teams in your environment.\\nLeverage the Teams RBAC to specify different levels of Teams administrative access |Using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), you can designate administrators who need different levels of access for managing Microsoft Teams. Administrators can manage the entire Teams workload, or they can have delegated permissions for troubleshooting call quality problems or managing your organization\'s telephony needs.\\nLimit the number of Office 365 Global Administrators|Having too many Office 365 Global Administrators might indicate that you\u2019ve not assigned the right individuals to manage your overall Office 365 environment. This could result in unwanted configuration changes to Office 365 if some of these individuals does not have the right skills or capabilities.\\nMulti Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enabled for Skype for Business Administrators and/or Office 365 Global Administrators|Make sure that any account who is in the Global Administrators or Skype for Business Online Administrators group are not enabled for Multi Factor Authentication (MFA). It is recommended to enable MFA for these accounts to add an additional layer of security during the authentication process.\\nOffice 365 Groups usage guidelines has not been put in-place|When users create or edit a group, you can show them a link to your organization\'s usage guidelines. For example, if you require a specific prefix or suffix to be added to a group name.\\nOld version of Skype for Business Network Assessment Tool detected|Using an older version of the Skype for Business Network Assessment Tool will impact the data collection.

Emergency access accounts are limited to emergency or \\"break glass\\"\' scenarios where normal administrative accounts can\'t be used. We recommend that you maintain a goal of restricting emergency account use to only the times when it is absolutely necessary. | High | High | Low |\\n| Review possible stale Guest (B2B) accounts | Guest accounts do not exist by default and pose a potential data exposure vulnerability if left unused.  Guest accounts should only be used with a defined business need and closely monitored to ensure accounts are valid/legitimate. | High | Moderate | Low |\\n| Remove invited guests who have not accepted invite | Remove invited guests who have not accepted invite as it helps control the scope of identity and access management as it pertains to provisioning users in Azure AD.   In addition, removing stale invites and user from Azure AD is part of the recommended routine account maintenance. | High | Low | Low |\\n| Enable Windows Hello for Business PIN Reset Service | The Microsoft PIN reset services enables you to help users recover who have forgotten their PIN. Using Group Policy, Microsoft Intune or a compatible MDM, you can configure Windows 10 devices to securely use the Microsoft PIN reset service that enables users to reset their forgotten PIN through settings or above the lock screen without requiring re-enrollment. | Low to Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Ensure security compliance notification mail is set | Managing security and compliance is a partnership. You are responsible for protecting your data, identities, and devices, while Microsoft vigorously protects Office 365 services. You can use Office 365 and Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) together to help you achieve the appropriate level of protection for your organization. | Low to Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Add owner to legacy Service Principal | Legacy service principals without a defined owner create a challenge for management and accountability. | Low to Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Add owner to application | Assigning an application owner provides an opportunity for delegation and establishes accountability for management of the resource. | Low to Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Add owner to cloud-only groups | Assigning a group owner provides an opportunity for delegation and establishes accountability for management of the resource. | Low to Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Require that users can create security groups is set to no | The creation and management of security groups should be restricted to administrators only to limit proliferation of this security principal.  The default setting is to prevent users from creating security groups in the Azure portal and it is recommended to maintain this configuration unless required by a defined business need. | Low to Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Delete empty cloud-only groups | Cloud-only groups that contain no members and are not associated with Azure applications should be deleted as they serve no purpose. | Low to Moderate | Low | Low |\\n| Review Dynamic Groups with membershipRuleProcessingState not turned on | Sometimes you may want to stop the processing of a dynamic group, like when you\u2019re importing a large number of new users or reorganizing your group architecture. To do that, use the MembershipRuleProcessingState parameter to switch processing on and off. | Low to Moderate | Low | Low |\\n| Review and consider federating all domains | When a domain is federated with Azure AD, several properties are set on the domain in Azure. One important one is IssuerUri. This property is a URI that is used by Azure AD to identify the domain that the token is associated with. | Low to Moderate | Low | Low |\\n| Review applications with credentials about to expire or are expired | Applications with expired credentials will prevent its use and should be updated before expiration to avoid an outage. If the application\'s service principal already has newer credentials remove the no longer valid credentials. | Moderate | High | Low |\\n| Review applications granted with risky OAUTH2 permissions | Depending on the scope of permissions, it can pose a risk to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the organization\'s data.  Periodic review of application permission grants can help identity over-privileged applications and establish access controls that align with the principle of least privilege. | Moderate | High | Low |\\n| Configure user passwords to never expire | Requesting users to regularly change passwords will lead to weak password practices like patterns or sequential words and numbers. | Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Review Service Principals using password based credentials | Protect and manage your confidential app credentials for web apps, web APIs and daemon apps. Use certificate credentials, not password credentials (client secrets). | Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Review Azure AD Guest (B2B) accounts | Guest accounts do not exist by default and pose a potential data exposure vulnerability if left unused.  Guest accounts should only be used with a defined business need and closely monitored to ensure accounts are valid/legitimate. | Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Review applications consented by admins | Review applications granted consent by admins to ensure this global configuration is desired, which results in authorization for applications to data for all users in the Azure AD tenant. | Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Review applications consented by one user | Review applications granted consent by a single users to ensure the configuration is desired, which results in authorization for applications to data for individual users as compared to admin consent which is global for the tenant. | Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Review domain password policies that do not match defaults. | Only passwords for user accounts that are not synchronized through directory synchronization can be configured for password policies.  By default users do not have a password policy defined. | Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Specify the usage location property for users | Some Microsoft services aren\'t available in all locations because of local laws and regulations. Before you can assign a license to a user, you must specify the Usage location property for the user. | Moderate | Moderate | Low |\\n| Require that users can consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf is set to no | Allowing users to provide consent for third-party applications risks exfiltration of personally identifiable information (PII) such as email and phone number, as it\'s associated with the user\'s profile. | High | High | Moderate |\\n| Review group license errors | These errors should be resolved and all users should be assigned expected licenses, for avoiding any loss of productivity. | High | Moderate | Moderate |\\n| Remove email / mailbox from directory role admins | To help separate internet risks (phishing attacks, unintentional web browsing) from administrative privileges, create dedicated accounts for each user with administrative privileges with no mail enabled to make sure they do not inadvertently open emails or run programs associated with their admin accounts. | Moderate | High | Moderate |\\n| Remove Skype address from directory role admins | To help separate internet risks (phishing attacks, unintentional web browsing) from administrative privileges, create dedicated accounts for each user with administrative privileges with no Skype Enabled to make sure they do not inadvertently open emails or run programs associated with their admin accounts. | Moderate | High | Moderate |\\n| Develop plan to migrate or remove legacy Service Principals | ServicePrincipals with ServicePrincipalType of legacy are not associated with an application and should be migrated to an application to improve manageability. | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |\\n| Federated domains in Azure AD must have SupportsMFA enabled if ADFS MFA is used | When the configured conditional access policy requires multi-factor authentication, Azure AD defaults to using Azure MFA. If you use the federation service for MFA, you can configure Azure AD to redirect to the federation service when MFA is needed by setting -SupportsMFA to $true in PowerShell. This setting works for federated authentication services that support the MFA challenge request issued by Azure AD | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |\\n| Verify all root level domains | Every new Azure AD tenant comes with an initial domain name, domainname.onmicrosoft.com. You can\'t change or delete the initial domain name, but you can add your organization\'s names to the list. Adding custom domain names helps you to create user names that are familiar to your users | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |\\n| Review user objects no longer syncing with on-premises | Users present in Windows Server AD and no longer syncing to Azure AD impacts users ability to use services provided by Azure AD (Password reset, access to O365 services and cloud based apps etc.) and it also poses administrative challenge in managing the account. | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |"},{"id":"azure/misc/how-to-restrict-users-to-specific-boards-in-azure-devops","metadata":{"permalink":"/azure/misc/how-to-restrict-users-to-specific-boards-in-azure-devops","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-28-how-to-restrict-users-to-specific-boards-in-azure-devops.md","title":"How to restrict users to specific boards in Azure DevOps","description":"Do you ever want to add external Microsoft Entra ID or other users to specific boards in a project, but not want to give them access to the entire Azure DevOps Project?","date":"2021-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"},{"label":"Misc","permalink":"/tags/misc"}],"readingTime":0.69,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"date":"2021-03-28 00:00:00 +1300","title":"How to restrict users to specific boards in Azure DevOps","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure","Misc"],"toc":false,"slug":"azure/misc/how-to-restrict-users-to-specific-boards-in-azure-devops"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Microsoft Entra ID Recommendations","permalink":"/2021/03/29/azure-active-directory-recommendations"},"nextItem":{"title":"Azure WebApp 500 Errors reporting from AspNetCoreModule","permalink":"/azure/azure-webapp-500-errors-reporting-from-aspnetcoremodule"}},"content":"Do you ever want to add external Microsoft Entra ID or other users to specific boards in a project, but not want to give them access to the entire Azure DevOps Project?\\n\\nUsing the steps below, we can restrict users to a specific board.\\n\\n1.

Yes, it\'s that type of article. The views expressed are purely my own.\\n\\nWe are at a turning point in history, where technology is enabling us to do more with less and faster, human life expectancy is longer than what it has ever been, and the world has never been as connected - We are in the 4th industrial revolution.\\n\\nIn an effort to continue to make things better, stronger, and faster we have developed technological aids to assist to drive us forward, in areas such as (but not only) Health, space exploration, travel, and business transformation, one could almost call it the evolution of the first hammer or axe as a tool to help us survive and thrive.\\n\\nAlthough there are many technologies in play around the world, artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, biotechnology, robotics, and the internet of things to name a few \u2013 faster computer processing capability and datacenters all connected to each other and built into the fabric of connectivity across the backbone of the internet, is what I am here to talk about today.\\n\\nCompanies such as Microsoft, in just over 11 years have revolutionized the world of Information Technology. The Microsoft Azure ecosystem is not just \u2018_someone else computer\u2019_, it is so much more than that.\\n\\nTraditional data centers or on-premises equipment use to require specialized knowledge around areas such as Networking and Hardware, every business function needed to have a physical server, taking up space in a specialized air-conditioned room or just sitting under someone\u2019s desk, running critical functions needed by businesses. I am not saying, this is still not the case and that there are no excuses for such implementations (other than running under someone\u2019s desk), what I am saying is that \u2018Information Technology was about Information **Technology**\u2019 \u2013 the \u2018Information\u2019 portion of that was a bit harder to access than it is today and was a lot more hands-on to drive value.\\n\\nCloud is disrupting traditional IT faster than we think. Today, with 80% of businesses deploying or fully embracing the cloud, we have \u2018crossed the chasm\u2019 and are in the \u2018early majority stage of the adoption curve.\\n\\n> \u201cA ship is safe in harbor, but that\'s not what ships are for.\u201d - William Shedd\\n\\nUsing and treating the Microsoft Azure ecosystem, like a normal on-premises datacenter in a world where \\"_a kid working in a garage anywhere in the world, can put you out of business\\"_ will slowly but surely limit your potential, with the global scale of the Azure platform, its now possible for businesses, charities and similarly minded individuals to have a global and multi-regional presence.\\n\\nIn the world of digital transformation, technology has become the source of competitive differentiation \u2013 If you haven\u2019t realized that your company is a technology company, you have already lost.\\n\\nInformation Technology functional requirements have changed from thinking of performance in terms of the central processing unit (CPU), and Random-access memory (RAM), to thinking about user experience (useability), portability, and scalability.\\n\\n![Azure DevOps](/uploads/devops.png \\"Azure DevOps\\")\\n\\nCloud-based thinking is migrating workloads from IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) to PaaS (Platform as a Service), or from PaaS to SaaS (Software as a Service), instead of you working for the technology, the technology works for you. \\n\\nThose previous Information Technology professionals that once worked till the early hours of the morning replacing hardware, keeping systems up and running, are now free to automate, simplify and understand how the technology can work for the consumer. They can now finally concentrate on helping you to deliver and concentrate on the **Information** that is now at your disposal.\\n\\n![Azure Built-in Controls](/uploads/azurebuiltincontrols.png)\\n\\nThe perimeter for security is no longer some black box, running in a dark room blinking into the night \u2013 it is your identity, your phone, your password (or password less). Security is everyone\u2019s concern and education of security and how to use technologies is just not the \u2018IT guys\u2019 responsibility.\\n\\nWhile the cloud can bring greater business value and agility, it can also bring new concerns, including cloud sprawl.\\n\\nWith the pace of change brought on by cloud-based digital technology, your business needs to be highly attuned to the capabilities, skills, and processes necessary from a people perspective to stay relevant and competitive.\\n\\nWhat can and cannot be achieved has now been limited by people\u2019s imaginations and the way that people work.\\n\\nWith companies now operating at a global stage and remote working, retaining talent has never become so important, the importance of a company mission statement, strategic priorities, and their \u2018Why\u2019 - to use the words of Simon Sinek _\u2018People don\'t buy what you do, they buy why you do it._\u2019 Has become a lot more important and visible as employees follow vision, leadership, and technology.\\n\\nLong story short so, what does this all mean?\\n\\nIn a few bullet points \u2013 this is some of what comes to mind when I think of having a Cloud frame of mind means:\\n\\n* Collaboration across Information Technology professionals (as the enablers) and Business needs have never been so important.\\n* Try, Try, Fail and Try again \u2013 Experiment!\\n* Think outside of the traditional box, into using technology across Cloud ecosystems such as Azure to drive outcomes.\\n* Partnerships with Microsoft and other businesses globally are important to learn, adapt and avoid reinventing the wheel.\\n* Shift from Captial to Operational expenses, subscription-based modelling and pay for what you use and consume.\\n* Enable, Trust and empower employees.\\n* Do not aim for perfection before moving forward or you will never get there.\\n* Use Analytics, Integration, and Machine Learning engines to help drive data-driven business decisions.\\n* Adopt a continuous learning culture.\\n* Embrace Chaos\\n* Remember that employee Utilisation does not equal maximum throughput.\\n* Build what you cannot buy. Buy what you can\'t live without\\n* Log what is useful, monitor what matters, alert on what\'s actionable.\\n* Empower others (ie shift left) while making sure that everything is auditable, standardized.\\n* Develop and promote an \u2018everything as code\u2019, \u2018everything is automated\u2019 mindset.\\n* Test and develop roadmaps to get the most out of upcoming Cloud capabilities.\\n* Educate employees on Security and the use of technology to get the most out of it.\\n* Remember that some of your clients\u2019 employees are not \u2018bogged\u2019 down by what they deem as not possible in IT.\\n* Take advantage of the variable cost model of the Cloud\\n* Design efficient use of resources via such activities as rightsizing (the process of resizing cloud resources to better match the workload requirements), allocating container costs, finding unused storage and compute, and identifying whether spending anomalies are expected.\\n* Automate what is trivial, boring, mundane, and belittling.\\n* The Cloud can offer cost savings with resiliency, high-availability, and security automation strategies, you just need to take advantage of it.\\n* Champion improvements in People/Process and ways of working\\n* Using the Cloud, does not always equal cost savings, however the real value is decreased time-to-deployment, increased agility to adapt to changes and opportunies for innovation, security and modernisation.\\n* Concentrate and continue on operational improvements, such as Incident and Problem Management\\n* Just as you have to have a push of changes, you have to have a pull of changes to keep the environment lean and avoid waste.\\n\\nAnd finally, Revisit, Improve and Reinvest... and enjoy the challenge and opportunities that being in the 4th industrial revolution has to offer! \\n\\nIt is surely an exciting time and is only just the beginning...\\n\\n![Cloud Word](/uploads/map.png \\"Word Cloud\\")"},{"id":"/2021/03/25/installing-the-rsat-remote-server-administration-tools-for-windows-10-tools-using-powershell","metadata":{"permalink":"/2021/03/25/installing-the-rsat-remote-server-administration-tools-for-windows-10-tools-using-powershell","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-25-installing-the-rsat-remote-server-administration-tools-for-windows-10-tools-using-powershell.md","title":"Installing RSAT Tools with PowerShell","description":"Installing the RSAT (Remote Server Administration Tools for Windows 10) tools using PowerShell.

You can check this using the following:\\n\\n    $currentPrincipal = New-Object Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal([Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent())\\n    $currentPrincipal.IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)\\n\\nIf it returns:\\n\\n* False - You are not in an elevated PowerShell window and will have to relaunch as Administrator\\n* True - You are all set to go and can continue...\\n\\nTo get a list of all the Remote Server Administration tools you can install run the following:\\n\\n    Get-WindowsCapability -Name RSAT.* -Online\\n\\nThe versions as of the time this article was written are:\\n\\n* Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.BitLocker.Recovery.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.CertificateServices.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.DHCP.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.Dns.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.FailoverCluster.Management.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.FileServices.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.GroupPolicy.Management.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.IPAM.Client.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.LLDP.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.NetworkController.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.NetworkLoadBalancing.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.RemoteAccess.Management.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.RemoteDesktop.Services.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.ServerManager.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.Shielded.VM.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.StorageMigrationService.Management.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.StorageReplica.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.SystemInsights.Management.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.VolumeActivation.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n* Rsat.WSUS.Tools\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~\\\\~0.0.1.0\\n\\nTo install ALL the RSAT Tools run the following:\\n\\n    Get-WindowsCapability -Name RSAT.* -Online | Add-WindowsCapability -Online\\n\\nTo only install ONLY the Active Directory Users & Computers Remote Administration tool run the following command:\\n\\n    Get-WindowsCapability -Name RSAT.ActiveDirectory* -Online | Add-WindowsCapability -Online\\n\\nTo only install ONLY the Group Policy Management Remote Administration tool run the following command:\\n\\n    Get-WindowsCapability -Name RSAT.GroupPolicy* -Online | Add-WindowsCapability -Online"},{"id":"/2021/03/25/unable-to-start-windows-azure-guest-agent-it-s-in-a-disabled-state.","metadata":{"permalink":"/2021/03/25/unable-to-start-windows-azure-guest-agent-it-s-in-a-disabled-state.","source":"@site/blog/2021-03-25-unable-to-start-windows-azure-guest-agent-it-s-in-a-disabled-state..md","title":"Unable to start Windows Azure Guest Agent (it\'s in a disabled state)","description":"Azure Backup Overview","date":"2021-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Azure","permalink":"/tags/azure"}],"readingTime":1.93,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Luke Murray","title":"Author","url":"https://luke.geek.nz","imageURL":"https://luke.geek.nz/img/logo.png","key":"Luke"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Unable to start Windows Azure Guest Agent (it\'s in a disabled state)","authors":["Luke"],"tags":["Azure"],"date":"2021-03-25 00:00:00 +1300","toc":true,"header":{"teaser":"images/iazure-marketplace-banner.png"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Installing RSAT Tools with PowerShell","permalink":"/2021/03/25/installing-the-rsat-remote-server-administration-tools-for-windows-10-tools-using-powershell"},"nextItem":{"title":"First look at Universal Automation Desktop","permalink":"/2020/02/29/First look at Universal Automation Desktop"}},"content":"![Azure Backup Overview](https://csharpcorner.azureedge.net/article/an-overview-of-azure-backup/Images/An%20Overview%20Of%20Azure%20Backup01.png)\\n\\n## Issue Description\\n\\nUnable to start Windows Azure Guest Agent (it\'s in a disabled state). When trying and set the service to auto the following error occurs \'The specified service has been marked for deletion.\'\\n\\nVM Agent is unable to communicate with the Azure Backup service.\\n\\n## Root Cause\\n\\nThis may occur if Windows Communication Framework (WCF) profiling is enabled. WCF profiling should only be enabled while debugging a WCF issue. It should not be left enabled while running a production workload.\\n\\n## Resolution #1\\n\\n1\\\\. Restart your workload, I would recommend to Stop (deallocate first) to make sure that the workload starts correctly on a new hypervisor, the Azure Backup agent starts and checks for agent updates during the boot process.\\n\\n## Resolution #2\\n\\nDisable WCF profiling:\\n\\n1\\\\. Launch an elevated CMD prompt.\\n2\\\\. Run the following commands to back up the existing: C:\\\\\\\\Windows\\\\\\\\Microsoft.NET\\\\\\\\Framework\\\\\\\\v4.0.30319\\\\\\\\Config\\\\\\\\machine.config file:\\n\\n       cd C:\\\\Windows\\\\Microsoft.NET\\\\Framework\\\\v4.0.30319\\\\Config\\n\\n       copy machine.config machine.config.bak\\n3\\\\. Run notepad machine.config to edit the file in Notepad.\\n\\nRemove this text, being careful not to also remove any additional text that may be on the same line:\\n\\n    <add name=\\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Diagnostics.ServiceModelSink.Behavior\\" type=\\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Diagnostics.ServiceModelSink.Behavior, Microsoft.VisualStudio.Diagnostics.ServiceModelSink, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a\\"/>\\n\\nAlso remove this text, being careful not to also remove any additional text that may be on the same line:\\n\\n    <commonBehaviors><endpointBehaviors><Microsoft.VisualStudio.Diagnostics.ServiceModelSink.Behavior/></endpointBehaviors><serviceBehaviors><Microsoft.VisualStudio.Diagnostics.ServiceModelSink.Behavior/></serviceBehaviors></commonBehaviors>\\n\\n4\\\\. Save and close the file.\\n5\\\\. Restart the guest agent services:\\n\\n    net stop Rdagent\\n    \\n    net stop WindowsAzureGuestAgent\\n    \\n    net stop WindowsAzureTelemetryService\\n    \\n    net start Rdagent\\n\\n6\\\\. In some cases the VM may need to be restarted for the WCF disablement to take effect.\\n\\n## Resolution #3\\n\\nFrom time to time the Azure backup agent may fail. Sometimes this will self-resolve but on the odd occasion, additional steps may be needed.\\n\\n1\\\\. Uninstall the agent via the Control Panel.\\n2\\\\. Open CMD as Admin.\\n3\\\\. Stop the following services:\\n\\n    net stop rdagent\\n    \\n    net stop WindowsAzureGuestAgent\\n    \\n    net stop WindowsAzureTelemetryService \\n\\n4\\\\. Delete all the services of the agent:\\n\\n    sc delete rdagent\\n    \\n    sc delete WindowsAzureGuestAgent\\n    \\n    sc delete WindowsAzureTelemetryService \\n   \\n5\\\\. Create a folder called OLD in \\"C:\\\\ WindowsAzure\\" and move the old version of the agent to it and the folders that say Packages.\\n6\\\\. Install the service again using the link: [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789&clcid=0x409](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789&clcid=0x409?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796 \\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789&clcid=0x409\\") or the latest agent available.  \\n7\\\\.

Each toolset has its place or specialization\\ntoday we are looking at the son of Ironman Software\u2019s PowerShell [Universal\\nAutomation](https://universalautomation.io/) platform \u2013 the Desktop Edition!\\n\\nThe Desktop edition replicates some of the same functionality as the Universal\\nAutomation platform, however, aimed more at being able to drive automation\\nscheduling from your Desktop! Entirely for someone like me who likes to do a\\ncertain amount of automation from the Desktop but has a particular distaste for\\nscheduled tasks \u2013 like the Universal Automation platform this is entirely driven\\nfor PowerShell!\\n\\n>   \u201cDesktop edition comes packaged as an Electron app that provides all the great\\n>   automation features of UA without role-based access, remote access or\\n>   authentication.\u201d\\n\\nYou can use Universal Automation Desktop for free as a trial:\\n\\n-   25 Jobs per day\\n\\n-   Up to 2 concurrent jobs\\n\\nWe are going to be using the Trial here \u2013 however, per-user pricing can be found\\nat the following link:  [Universal Automation](https://ironmansoftware.com/universal-automation/)\\n\\nThe toolset is quite intuitive a lot of below isn\u2019t worth going into how do use\\nit - as it seems to be easy to pick up but its always pleasant to have it documented\\nand referable! In my example below, we are going to\\ncreate a Resource Group in Azure.\\n\\n* TOC\\n{:toc}\\n\\n\\n## Install Universal Automation Desktop:\\n\\nUnlike Universal Automation & Universal Dashboard, installation of the Universal\\nAutomation Desktop is packaged into an executable.\\n\\n1.  Download the latest [Universal Automation\\n    Desktop](https://ironmansoftware.com/downloads/) installer (bottom of the\\n    download pages \u2013 at time of writing the installer is 120MB and version\\n    1.0.0)\\n2.  Installation of Universal Automation Desktop is pretty straight forward,\\n    just run the downloaded installer:\\n![UniversalAutomationInstall](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_Installer.png)\\n3.  Once complete, Universal Automation Desktop will load.\\n\\n## Use & Configure Universal Automation Desktop:\\n\\nAdd Scripts\\n-----------\\n\\nUniversal Automation supports git, so a Repository folder is created\\nautomatically \u2013 any scripts that you add will automatically be added to it:\\n\\n%LOCALAPPDATA%\\\\\\\\UniversalAutomation\\\\\\\\Repository\\n\\n1. On the Scripts pane select Add Scripts\\n![UniversalAutomationScriptsPane](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_ScriptsPane.png)\\n2. Select the script you want to upload \u2013 in my example; I am using\\n    \u2018New-AzureResourceGroup.ps1\u2019 the script I created for quickly testing some\\n    of the functionality.\\n>   Gist of script found below, but its also in my GitHub Repository under\\n>   Azure (GitHub link on the site menu).\\n3. Once added you should see the script appear and you should be able to see it\\n    in the Repository folder now:\\n![UniversalAutomationScriptsPanePopulated](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_ScriptsPanePopulated.png)\\n\\n## Add variables\\n\\nUniversal Automation Desktop supports variables.\\n\\n1. Click on the Variables menu item\\n2. Select Add Variable\\n3. In my example, I am adding the location that the Resource Group will be\\n    created, so it is going to be the following Key = Value pair: Location = Australia East\\n4. Click Ok to save\\n\\nNote: Location is a variable in my script, I also tested manually setting the\\nname of the Resource Group as well with the Name value as well and worked well.\\n\\n![UniversalAutomationVariablesPopulated](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_Variables.png)\\n\\nNote: The Variables are not encrypted! They are in plain text under:\\n\\nRepository\\\\\\\\.ua\\\\\\\\variables.ps1\\n\\nI did have a few issues with the UI freezing on me, so also discovered that I\\ncan manually add variables to this file and after a restart, it seemed to be\\npicked up by Universal Automation as well.\\n\\n![UniversalAutomationVariablesVSCode](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_VariablesVSCode.png)\\n\\n## Change PowerShell version\\n\\nThis is an interesting feature, that allows you to specify what Version of\\nPowerShell you can have the scripts run under (in this example I will be adding\\nPowerShell 7 preview). We do not need this for my example.\\n\\nNote: If you do not see the below, you may need to update \u2013 Automation Desktop\\nwill update automatically and should notify you \u2013 close and restart Automation\\nDesktop to continue (if you get an error message \u2013 navigate to your notification\\ntray by the time and Quit any open Universal Automation Desktop applications you\\nhave open and then relaunch).\\n\\n1. Click Settings\\n2. Navigate down to PowerShell versions\\n3. Click Add New Version\\n4. A new Table row will appear (Version\\\\\\\\Path)\\n5. In Version we are going to type in: PowerShell 7-preview (x64)\\n6. In path type in: C:\\\\\\\\Program Files\\\\\\\\PowerShell\\\\\\\\7-preview\\\\\\\\pwsh.exe\\n7. Press Enter\\n![UniversalAutomationPowerShellVersions](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_PowerShellVersions.png)\\n\\nNow when you run your scripts, you can now specify what Version of PowerShell to\\nuse!\\n\\n## Run the script\\n\\nNow that the variables have been set up and the script has been added, we can\\nthen Run it.\\n\\n1. On the scripts pane select \u2018New-AzureResourceGroup.ps1\u2019 and select Run\\n![Universal_Automation_ScriptsRun](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_ScriptsRun.png)\\n2. Specify the PowerShell version \u2013 I believe automating this selection is\\n    currently in the backlog: - and click Run\\n![Universal_Automation_ScriptsRunVersion](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_ScriptsRunVer.png)\\n3. The script will now go to the Jobs screen:\\n![Universal_Automation_ScriptsRunJob](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_ScriptsRunJob.png)\\n4. Usually, the script would just run \u2013 but in my case, I have a parameter in\\n    my PowerShell script to request the name of the Resource Group we are going\\n    to create, click on Response to Feedback icon\\n5. Type in the name of the Resource Group we are going to create \u2013 in my\\n    example I am going with: UAutomationRGTest and click Ok\\n![Universal_Automation_VariablesFeedback](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_VariablesFeedback.png)\\n6. It will now run the script:\\n![Universal_Automation_Script Runs](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_ScriptsRunJob2.png)\\n7. My new Resource Group has been created in Azure, using the name specified in\\n    the Parameter (UAutomationRGTest) and the Location (Australia East) that was\\n    set in the Variables!\\n\\n![Universal_Automation_Azure Resource Group created](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_AzureResourceGroupCreated.png)\\n\\n## Scheduling scripts\\n\\nAlthough at this stage, I am not scheduling any of my scripts to run \u2013 it is a\\ncore function of the toolset.\\n\\n1. Click on Scripts\\n2. Select the script you want to schedule and select View\\n3. On the right-hand side blade next to Edit, click on the ellipsis (i.e.\u2026)\\n  ![Universal_Automation_Schedule](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_Schedule1.png)\\n4. Select Schedule\\n  ![Universal_Automation_Schedule](/images/posts/Universal_Automation_Schedule2.png)\\n5. Specify the schedule you want and click Ok\\n\\nYou should now see the Schedule under Schedules and view the Job history under\\nJobs.\\n\\n## Overall opinion\\nLong story short - Universal Automation has a place and is a toolset I will be looking at more closely and using!\\n\\nI see myself using it to utilize PowerShell and automation a bit more in completion of general day to day activities (both personal and professional) and service requests - without having to worry about moving to the next step with a bigger toolset.\\n\\nIf I use a script often enough \u2013 then there will be a definite need to move to another team based toolset with RBAC tools such as the Universal Automation offering by Adam Driscoll of Ironman Software.\\n\\nWord of warning \u2013 and it should go without saying :\\n\\n**DO NOT RUN UNIVERSAL AUTOMATION DESKTOP ON YOUR DOMAIN COMPUTER FOR PRODUCTION\\nOR SHARED SCRIPTS! PLEASE LOOK AT UNIVERSAL AUTOMATION FOR THAT! YOU DON\u2019T WANT\\nTO GO HOME OR SHUTOFF YOUR PC OR LEAVE FOR BETTER AND BRIGHTER THINGS AND GET\\nCALLED UP BECAUSE SOME VERY IMPORTANT PROCESS DIDN\u2019T RUN!** \\n\\n## My Test Script - New-AzureResourceGroup\\n\\nI created this function to quickly test 2 things:\\n\\n-   How does Universal Automation work with 3rd party modules?\\n\\n-   How does Universal Automation work with parameters and variables?\\n\\nUniversal Automation Desktop does not touch your scripts, in fact depending on\\nwhat your use case is your git repository should be inline with Automation\\nDesktop and you can sync the Variables across multiple installs.\\n\\nMy script is using 2 modules:\\n\\n-   CredentialManager\\n\\n-   Azure (AZ)\\n\\nI thought CredentialManager would be a good test here as Universal Automation is\\nintended to be run from your Desktop (in my case Windows 10) and using\\nCredential Manager to store my Azure SPN details \u2013 without revealing it in plan\\ntext was a good test.

Microsoft Azure has a \u2018[Billing Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\u2019 role which may be helpful to give someone visibility of costs in Microsoft Azure, also be aware of what roles users have, and what they can do with it, you don\u2019t want to give someone Contributor rights over a subscription and have them create a ton of resources when all they needed was Reader rights to view someone else work or skip internal processes for deploying resources.\\n\\nIf you haven\u2019t already \u2013 I highly recommend getting an [Azure Scaffold](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/resources/azure-scaffold?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) or Governance model in place to help determine how you not only use Azure, but how you manage the costs \u2013 whether it\u2019s per subscription-based or Resource Groups, the use of Tags to tag Azure resources based on cost center or department etc is invaluable.\\n\\n## Pricing Calculator\\n\\nThe first place to start in the journey of managing technical costs in Azure is the Pricing Calculator\\n\\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796)\\n\\nThe Pricing Calculator allows you to select various Azure services (Virtual Machines, App Services Plans, IoT Hubs) and work out estimated pricing vs criteria which may be service-specific such as runtime, geo-redundancy, the amount of storage required etc. You need to know whether a service is costing money if it is running, how many read/writes is allowed, etc. I recommend spending some time looking through the Pricing Calculator and various services that Microsoft Azure offers to get a feel of cost \u2013 if you are in NZ (make sure to select \u2018New Zealand Dollar\u2019), the default is US.\\n\\n## Cost Visibility across Subscriptions & Resource Groups\\n\\nThe Microsoft Azure Portal offers a lot of visibility into the cost of running resources in Azure, whether you want to look at the costs per subscription or in this example the Resource Group.\\n\\nYou can find the cost information under the \u2018Resource Costs\u2019 blade in the Resource Group or \u2018Cost Analysis\u2019 at a Resource Group level.\\n\\n![Azure Resource Group Costs](/images/posts/appservice_resourcecosts.png)\\n\\nUsing the built-in Azure Portal tools you filter costs based on Time/Date and Tags.\\n\\nOn the Overview Blade of an Azure Subscription, you can see the highest costs by Resource type and estimated cost based on current consumption.\\n\\n![Azure Subscription Forecast](/images/posts/subscription_costs_forecast.png)\\n\\n## Invoices & Consumption Insights\\n\\nFor those of you who pay by Credit Card or want to know the Pre-tax costs of your Azure resources, you can go to your subscription and click on the Invoices blade to review current and previous invoices, if not set up already I recommend you configure the Email Invoice to send the invoice to your Billing Administrator automatically.\\n\\nIf you are on an Enterprise Agreement, you can setup [Microsoft Azure Consumption Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-azure-consumption-insights?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) PowerBI pack to help give visibility of Azure costs through the use of the API key from your enrolment portal.\\n\\n## Azure Policies\\n\\nAlong with your Cloud Scaffold or Governance framework, you need to be able to force or guide your environment, [Azure Policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) can be used to not only keep your Azure ecosystem in alignment but stop the creation of unapproved resources, high costing Virtual Machines, or resources in specific regions, you can use Azure Policies to Audit resources or completely prevent them from being created. Azure Policy samples can be at the [azure-policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/samples) git repository.\\n\\n## Hybrid Use Benefit\\n\\nIf you already own on-premises Windows Server/SQL server licenses \u2013 you may be eligible for [HUB (Hybrid Use Benefit)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-benefit/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796) which allows you to run certain machines, based on licensed cores in Azure under the same Windows Server licensing for no additional cost, this can be enabled in the Azure Portal on a Virtual Machine with no downtime.\\n\\n## Azure Advisor & Reserved Instances\\n\\nMicrosoft has built an\xa0Advisor into Azure, this Advisor not only gives Security & Performance recommendations, it also includes Cost Recommendations\\n\\n![Azure Advisor](/images/posts/azureadvisorbutton.png)\\n\\n![Azure Reserved Instance](/images/posts/azurerihub.png)\\n\\nThese Cost recommendations, are based on CPU usage of workloads (and can be adjusted) \u2013 such as workloads running at 5% CPU utilization for the past 14 days and recommends Cost Savings by resizing down the Virtual Machine.\\n\\nThe Azure Advisor also recommends [Reserved Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/reserved-vm-instances/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796), instead of \u2018Pay As You Go\u2019 or \u2018Pay As You Consume\u2019 Opex model, you pay for the Virtual Machines up-front (think capital expenditure) for 1 or 3-year terms, in some cases, you can get 72% savings and if you have machines you know will be on 24/7 and won\u2019t need resizing \u2013 think Infrastructure servers, such as Domain Controllers then Reserved Instances are a good idea.\\n\\n## Last Considerations\\n\\nYou need to be aware that pricing in the Azure Portal or Pricing Calculator, may not show all costs. These price indications are only based on the service or size of a resource, they do not take into consideration Network dependencies such as data egress (data leaving Azure), storage replication, etc \u2013 the reality is, is sometimes the only way to know how much something will cost is to provision it, use it and monitor the costs.\\n\\nA side bit of information also is that although a service might cost x in AustraliaEast it may be a lot cheaper to run it in the US for example. Hence, if you need to spin something up quickly or test it and not concerned about latency or data sovereignty then check out [Azure Price](https://azureprice.net/?currency=NZD), this website lists the cost of the Virtual Machines, their costs, and recommended regions to get in some cases 30-40% cost savings."},{"id":"/2018/06/11/dfs-namespace-service-not-starting-reboot","metadata":{"permalink":"/2018/06/11/dfs-namespace-service-not-starting-reboot","source":"@site/blog/2018-06-11-dfs-namespace-service-not-starting-reboot.md","title":"Using PowerShell to start the DFS Namespace service","description":"Distributed File System (DFS) has some service dependencies - so if those don\'t start the DFS Namespace service will also not start.","date":"2018-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"PowerShell","permalink":"/tags/power-shell"}],"readingTime":2.5,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Using PowerShell to start the DFS Namespace service","tags":["PowerShell"],"date":"2018-06-11 00:00:00 +1300","header":{"teaser":"images/powershell-blog-feature-banner.png"}},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How to manage cost in Microsoft Azure","permalink":"/2018/12/19/How to manage cost in Microsoft Azure"},"nextItem":{"title":"Using PowerShell to connect to Microsoft Azure","permalink":"/2018/06/10/Using PowerShell to connect to Azure"}},"content":"Distributed File System (DFS) has some service dependencies - so if those don\'t start the DFS Namespace service will also not start.\\n\\n<img class=\\"alignnone\\" src=\\"https://i1.wp.com/luke.geek.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/121316_0835_DFSNamespac1.png?resize=584%2C112\\" alt=\\"DFS Namespace\\" width=\\"584\\" height=\\"112\\" data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" />\\n\\nThe dependencies are:\\n\\n * Remote Registry\\n * Security Accounts Manager\\n * Server\\n * Workstation\\n\\nI have seen the Remote Registry service become the culprit of the DFS-N service not starting.\\n\\nIn my experience, this had been caused by antivirus software changing the Remote Registry service to Disabled start-up type so when the DFS-N server restarts, one of the dependency services:\\n\\nRemote Registry does not start so if you have issues with the DFS-N service not starting \u2013 check the Remote Registry Start-up type is configured to Automatic and click Start to confirm there are no errors and try starting the DFS-N service again.\\n\\n*Note: RemoteRegistry \u2013 although it is Automatic, will only Start when it is being used so don\'t be alarmed if it is in a \'Stopped\' state.*\\n  \\n<img class=\\"alignnone\\" src=\\"https://i2.wp.com/luke.geek.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/121316_0835_DFSNamespac2.png?resize=377%2C267\\" alt=\\"Remote Registry\\" width=\\"377\\" height=\\"267\\" data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" />\\n\\nI have also created a PowerShell script to do some general checking for the DFS namespace service \u2013 which sets the Remote Registry service to Automatic startup then gets the other DFS dependency services and changes the startup type to Automatic and starts them and finally tries to start the DFS Namespace service.\\n\\n```powershell title=\\"Start-DFS.ps1\\"\\n\\n#requires -Version 2.0\\n\\n<#\\n.SYNOPSIS\\n  Starts the DFS service\\n\\n.DESCRIPTION\\n  Changes the Remote Registry service to Automatic start-up and Start the DFS NameSpace service dependencies, then start the DFS namespace service. \\n  If the service does not start, it will retrieve the last 10 event log items from the DFS log.\\n\\n.NOTES\\n  Version:        1.0\\n  Author:         Luke Murray (Luke.Geek.NZ)\\n  Creation Date:  20/03/17\\n  Purpose/Change: \\n  20/03/17 - Initial script development\\n  11/06/18 - Updated script formatting\\n\\n.EXAMPLE\\n  ./Start-DFS-Service.ps1\\n  \\n#>\\n\\n#---------------------------------------------------------[Script Parameters]------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n$ServiceName = \'DFS\'\\n$ErrorActionPreference = \'Stop\'\\n\\n#-----------------------------------------------------------[Execution]------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTry \\n{\\n  Get-Service -Name RemoteRegistry | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic\\n}\\nCatch \\n{\\n  Write-Verbose -Message \'There is an issue changing the Remote Registry Service to Automatic Startup Type\' -Verbose\\n}\\nTry\\n{\\n  $ServiceDependency = Get-Service -Name $ServiceName -DependentServices\\n  $ServiceDependency | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic | Start-Service\\n  Write-Verbose -Message \\"$ServiceName dependencies have started.

This event features sessions from key speakers, usually the top of their fields on their respective technologies covering the entire Microsoft stack and soft skill sessions such as dealing with stress etc. You can find out more \u2013 at the MS Ignite webpage &#8211; <a href=\\"https://msignite.nz/why-attend\\" target=\\"_blank\\">https://msignite.nz/why-attend</a>\\n\\nThis event was held at Sky City in Auckland, New Zealand between the 25<sup>th</sup> \u2013 28<sup>th</sup> of October 2016.\\n\\nThis was an event I had been eager to attend for a few years, so finally being privileged enough to attend and experience it all was well worth the wait!\\n\\n### <span id=\\"Day_1_Tuesday_25th_October_2016\\">Day 1 (Tuesday 25<sup>th</sup> October 2016):</span>\\n\\nDay 1 consisted of getting to Sky City early for the Exam Cram sessions hosted by Auldhouse _(and of course coffee!)_\\n\\nThe exam cram sessions were a high level overview of the Microsoft Azure platform for: **70-533 &#8211; Implementing Microsoft Infrastructure Solutions & 70-534 &#8211; Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions**. This content was intended to turn the normal 5-day course offered by Auldhouse into 60 minute slots with the intention of giving an overview of features like ARM (Azure Resource Manager) and of course Azure WebApps and Virtual Machines.\\n\\nAs someone who supports the VMWare virtualization stack \u2013 I don\u2019t have the privilege of working with the Microsoft Azure stack on a BAU basis however having stood up Azure Virtual Machines and WebApps in the past it was useful in seeing other aspects of the Azure Cloud and the advancements that Microsoft have made to their Cloud solution and how they are disrupting the market and pushing technology to its potential. It is definitely an exciting time!\\n\\nThese sessions were well worth attending and I gained huge value attending \u2013 thanks to Auldhouse for putting them on.\\n\\nAfter the Exam Cram sessions \u2013 was **the Keynote**!\\n\\nThe keynote was the opening salvo for the rest of the conference! It certainly set the pace and the right attitude!\\n\\n> _\u201cWe are living in one of the most extraordinary times in the history of our planet. Where transformation is at the very heart of the matter. We must transform or we will perish. Our Flame will die! Transform the way we do things, the way we do business, the way we live, the way we create, innovate and inspire&#8221; \u2013 Hilary Barry_\\n> \\n> _\u201cOur industry does not respect tradition \u2014 it only respects innovation\u201d \u2013 Hilary Barry/Satya Nadella_\\n> \\n> _\u201cThe art of the possible\u201d \u2013 Hilary Barry_\\n\\nThis keynote featured a few awesome demos \u2013 that included but not limited to \u2013 The Microsoft Surface Hub \u2013 an awesome touch capable \u2018whiteboard\u2019 device running a variant of the Windows 10 operating system that leans towards team collaboration and sharing. A presentation by Donovan Brown on DevOps! As a developer he demonstrated Visual Studio and Visual Studio Team Services using the Build and Deploy release management! He was able to add changes to a mobile application _(OS independent)_ _\u2018People Tracker\u2019_ during the demo and build the new version live \u2013 this was awesome and from an IT Professional perspective this was great insight into the DevOps pipeline. This was a great lead up to Regan Murphy from Microsoft New Zealand, displaying the Azure DevTest Lab \u2013 using the power of the Azure Cloud to stand up development/test environments in a standard and quick way and they now have automatic shutdown and start up at designated time \u2013 saving businesses a lot of money and allowing the environments to be accessible when required. Dona Sarkar the Windows Insider Program Lead from Microsoft Redmond also had a huge section of the Keynote! Her speech was more soft skills then technical but was definitely worth listening too! Dona was very inspiring with \u201c_hustle the humans_\u201d and using words like Experiment and not Project to try out new ideas and add value!\\n\\n> _\u201cWe are all creative!\u201d \u2013 Dona Sarkar_\\n> \\n> _\u201cThe only real failure is not starting at all!\u201d \u2013 Dona Sarkar_\\n\\n<div style=\\"width: 740px\\" class=\\"wp-caption alignnone\\">\\n  <a href=\\"https://i2.wp.com/luke.geek.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image-1.png\\"><img title=\\"image\\" src=\\"https://i2.wp.com/luke.geek.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image_thumb-1.png?resize=730%2C233\\" alt=\\"Keynote\\" width=\\"730\\" height=\\"233\\" data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" /></a>\\n  \\n  <p class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">\\n    MS Ignite NZ 2016 Keynote\\n  </p>\\n</div>\\n\\nAfter the keynote I began my technical sessions _(each technical session was 60 minutes)!_\\n\\nAs the primary subject matter expert in System Centre Configuration Manager (SCCM) at work \u2013 it was natural that my first session was:\\n\\n**30 things you should never do with System Center Configuration Manager!** This was a pretty light and hilarious but at the same time serious session detailing how not to do deployment \u2013 such deploy to All Systems and how dangerous the software is! It was also clarification and a push that I needed to take a fresh look at the role-based access control (RBAC) for the users and teams using the SCCM environment and re-evaluate what permissions they actual need to do their job to reduce configuration drift against the SCCM standards and to reduce the accidental collection deletion or untoward deployment that would be a resume ending event!\\n\\nAfter some afternoon tea \u2013 my next session was: **Reducing the network impact of Windows 10 feature and quality updates** &#8211; the speaker for this session was Michael Niehaus one of the top experts in Windows deployment and management. This session detailed \u2018_Windows as a service_\u2019 Microsoft push with Windows 10 management \u2013 in terms of Feature updates and their size, and getting into the rhythm of maintaining and keeping the Windows Desktop and image up to date. With rough Feature update sizes about 3.5GB every 6 months this needs awareness and some changes to SCCM cache size on the endpoint devices \u2013 such as changing this to 10GB and using technologies such as Branch Cache Distributed Hosts or Configuration Manager Peer Cache to distribute the updates and allow them to be distributed from endpoint devices to other endpoint devices on the same subnet reducing the hit to the distribution points \u2013 which works well with the fluid nature of the SCCM client check-in _(one client will check in and store the update to the local cache, allowing the next client on the subnet that checks in to retrieve the content from that endpoint device without having to connect back to the datacentre and hit the distribution points)_.\\n\\n### <span id=\\"Day_2_Wednesday_26th_October_2016\\">Day 2 (Wednesday 26<sup>th</sup> October 2016):</span>\\n\\nDay 2 \u2013 After the first day \u2013 I now knew where the rooms were for the sessions and was able to get myself into the rhythm. With my sessions and their locations added to my Calendar I was easily able to go from session to session without an issue \u2013 which was good timing considering this was the first full day of sessions!\\n\\nI started the day with a soft-skills session &#8211; **Stay in control when everything is out of control, and other brain hacks for techies** this was held in the Sky City Theatre which and was very fascinating! The session revealed a few tricks to do while stress *_breathe_* and ways of thinking such as being the devil\u2019s advocate for yourself as everyone is bias with their own opinions because of their personal and professional experiences, seeing how the other people may think differently and why they may thing differently. An interesting fact \u2013 because of the glucose levels \u2013 judges were much more likely to accept prisoners\u2019 requests for parole at the beginning of the day than the at end after they had a break or a fresh start!\\n\\nNext up was another soft session which was again quite interesting &#8211; **Microsoft&#8217;s trusted and secure cloud services** this session was led by Join Russell Craig, Microsoft NZ National Technology Officer and Michael Brick from Microsoft\u2019s NZ Legal counsel and their discussion revolved around Azure Cloud Security. This was interesting in the development and the security certifications the Microsoft Azure platforms gets audited upon a daily basis. It is aligned to just about all security standards including Cloud Security Alliance and the GCIO and that New Zealand Clinical data was authorized and was getting stored on the Azure datacentres in Australia with the New Zealand government having a \u2018_cloud first_\u2019 approach which includes the Azure stack where applicable. This potentially opens up the ability for Office 365 and other Microsoft services for the New Zealand Health Industry outside of just identity management.\\n\\n**From 0 to DevOps** was the next one I attended \u2013 this was an awesome session by Donovan Brown who used Visual Studio and Team Services in Azure to create a release pipeline from Visual Studio on his workstation device, uploaded to Team Services in Azure. He showed automated builds and how it could be used to build to Dev, UAT or Production at the same time using any language. He demonstrated using the Node JS language on an Ubuntu platform _(also running PowerShell \u2013 how cool is that)_ and then deployed to Team Services. The full stack that Donovan uses the following DevOps processes:\\n\\n**Plan** _(Plan Work)_ **->** **Infra** _(Configure/Provision Environment)_ **->** **Test** (_Manual/Automated Test) **-> Approve** (Notify/Collect Approvals) **-> Monitor** (Diagnostics/Performance)_\\n\\n<div style=\\"width: 760px\\" class=\\"wp-caption alignnone\\">\\n  <a href=\\"https://i2.wp.com/luke.geek.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image-2.png\\"><img title=\\"image\\" src=\\"https://i1.wp.com/luke.geek.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image_thumb-2.png?resize=750%2C327\\" alt=\\"From 0 to DevOps\\" width=\\"750\\" height=\\"327\\" data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" /></a>\\n  \\n  <p class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">\\n    \u201cDevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.\u201d \u2013 Donovan Brown\\n  </p>\\n</div>\\n\\nThis was an awesome session \u2013 especially from an Infrastructure Engineer point of view, this helped me gain insight into the Developer world and some of the processes that should be used in conjunction with PowerShell scripting, as DevOps becomes more supported and Operations and Development mingle. Source Control people!\\n\\nAfter some lunch supplied by Microsoft and Sky City it was time to head to my next session:\\n\\n**Customizing Windows 10: Image Creation Tips and Tricks** \u2013 another session by Michael Niehaus. This session was a lot of value in relation to doing image engineering with MDT 2013 Update 2. Having experience in MDT image creation for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 \u2013 I gained a lot of value in understanding about best practices in terms of where to place the AppX package removal steps in the reference task sequence (just after the WinPE phase \u2013 before the OS starts) and how Windows 10 1607 will allow the Task Bar to be customized using the StartLayout export XML! About time! There was also a demo about adding in a language pack requires multiple downloads and merged into an MDT Application to add as part of the base WIM.\\n\\n<div style=\\"width: 339px\\" class=\\"wp-caption alignnone\\">\\n  <a href=\\"https://i2.wp.com/luke.geek.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image-3.png\\"><img title=\\"image\\" src=\\"https://i0.wp.com/luke.geek.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image_thumb-3.png?resize=329%2C255\\" alt=\\"Customizing Windows 10: Image Creation Tips and Tricks\\" width=\\"329\\" height=\\"255\\" data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" /></a>\\n  \\n  <p class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">\\n    Microsoft Ignite NZ 2016 &#8211; Windows 10: Image Creation Tips and Tricks!\\n  </p>\\n</div>\\n\\nThe next session I attended with was **The 9 Group Policy Principals that all IT Administrators should know!** This session was useful to reinforce best practice in terms of not using Block inheritance, Loop Back processing or of course to not use login scripts and wait for network! He also touched on plain text passwords in the group policy and of course the recent Microsoft patch (MS16-072) that resulted in some Group Policies not applying after Authenticated users had been removed The speaker was Alan Burchill who is a Group Policy MVP! So was right on track! Sometimes it\u2019s good to take this kind of session \u2013 that allows you to take a step back to look at what may be setup or in use in a \u201cfriends\u201d organization and what may and should be done to remedy it! Was a highly valuable session which was something that everyone running Active Directory would have got value out of it straight away, that doesn\u2019t cost money!\\n\\nLast official session of the day was: **Windows 10 Deployments: What I wish I knew before I started** by a New Zealand Microsoft consultant, Brendan Byrne. I got a lot of value from this session as it was down to earth, wasn\u2019t a sales pitch and revealed a few things to keep in mind going forward \u2013 such as not thinking of Windows 10 as Windows 7. Thinking about using features such as Credential Guard and moving to UE-V for user profile management.\\n\\nAfter that \u2013 and the Hub Happy hour \u2013 I attended mini session at the Citrix booth that had a demo and slides for using Citrix AppDNA for Application Migration and compatibility testing,\\n\\n### <span id=\\"Day_3_Thursday_27th_October_2016\\">Day 3 (Thursday 27<sup>th</sup> October 2016):</span>\\n\\nThis day was an awesome day \u2013 I did miss the Windows Device Smack down! session as I was using the session time to catch up with a few people! One of the best things about Microsoft Ignite NZ 2016 was being able to catch up with people \u2013 whether they are people you have worked with or vendors! It was definitely a social geek fest! I also missed Demystifying the Windows Firewall \u2013 Learn how to irritate attackers without crippling your network because I had to do some work but will definitely check it out later on the Channel9 website once the session has been uploaded _(link is below this post)_!\\n\\n**Configuring and Deploying Just Enough and Just-In-Time Administration** \u2013 ****Awesome session, and was very interesting! The speaker for this session was: Orin Thomas who is an MVP and awesome technical writer (own a few of his books)! This session details using Just in Time Administration \u2013 Privileged Access Management which is a technology by Microsoft that utilizes Microsoft Identity Manager, to have a one-way forest trust with a privileged forest. The idea basically is a user goes to the Microsoft Identity Manager webpages and requests access such as \u2018Domain Admin\u2019 once that access is approved \u2013 MIM elevates a user\u2019s system admin account for a designated time (for example 30 minutes) which then the user does the work and then MIM removes the elevated rights from the user after this time. The idea is no one is a member of an AD group unless they actually need it and then for a certain amount of time. This would work in well with Change Control, as part of the implementation steps you need to figure out how long the Change would be and add in a step to request the specified access for the time of that action that is then automatically removed. PAM supports any Active Directory group which is also handy \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be an Active Directory Built-in group! Just Enough Administration (JEA) is all about granting a virtual token/account to a user based on a specific role that will only allow them to run very specific PowerShell commands \u2013 such as the demo Orin used as the ability to restart DNS servers, add DNS A records but not able to restart any other server or touch them! Very cool technology that I can see becoming the standard in terms of Role Based Access Control and PowerShell! This session gave me some concepts to think over!\\n\\n**Righting the Right Rights &#8211; Active Directory & Domain Security, Administration & Maintenance** was my next session (which was luckily in the same room!) The speaker for this session was Jess Dodson from Australia! An MVP! This was a very fascinating and awesome session regarding Active Directory replication, Active Directory security which included Delegation \u2013 being more proactive in terms of AD event log monitoring and collecting and included maintenance and recommendations for Microsoft Entra ID and checking sync replication. This was another of those sessions that I can instantly get the most value from without having to spend money from \u2013 well worth a watch!! A Healthy Active Directory \u2013 keeps the Users away (I mean happy)!\\n\\nSecond to last session of the day was: **Everything you forgot to ask about Certificate Services** this was another session by Orin Thomas! Orin pretty much went back to basics on this session \u2013 what a RootCA is, Subordinates and explained CRLS. Certificate Services is usually something very important but often neglected so was great to attend this session which reminded me about how it all worked and gave me an idea that I had never considered before \u2013 Using System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) to monitor for expiring certificates! Definitely something that needs looking into!\\n\\nMy last session was then &#8211; **Enabling DevOps from an IT Pro perspective** this was a very interesting session using Team Services \u2013 this session had x2 speakers &#8211; Callum Lowe a Microsoft New Zealand &#8211; Premier Field Engineer (more from an Infrastructure/Operational background) and Daniel Larsen \u2013 another Field Engineer that was more from the Development side of the house. They simulated the build and deployment \u2013 Daniel gave his requirements to Callum who then used Team Services and Visual Studio to develop the necessary ARM templates to spin up the resources in Azure. This was a session that helped give some context to DevOps and how the people is a big part of the 3 ways.\\n\\nThursday night of course \u2013 was the MS Ignite New Zealand 2016 party! The food was awesome, with selections of Seafood, BBQ, Asian! Revera Cloud Services had custom made Beer made for the event which was awesome and the entertainment of the night was New Zealand band Shapeshifter! Which had me head banging and fist pumping! This was held at Shed 10 on the Auckland harbor \u2013 band was on the bottom floor and a few Xboxes, Table Tennis, VR gaming was at the top floor! Was #Epic! I hadn\u2019t had that much fun in a while!\\n\\n<div style=\\"width: 756px\\" class=\\"wp-caption alignnone\\">\\n  <a href=\\"https://i2.wp.com/luke.geek.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image-4.png\\"><img title=\\"image\\" src=\\"https://i2.wp.com/luke.geek.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image_thumb-4.png?resize=746%2C190\\" alt=\\"Thursday Night - Ignite NZ Party\\" width=\\"746\\" height=\\"190\\" data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" /></a>\\n  \\n  <p class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">\\n    Microsoft Ignite NZ 2016 Party!\\n  </p>\\n</div>\\n\\n### <span id=\\"Day_4_Friday_28th_October_2016\\">Day 4 (Friday 28<sup>th</sup> October 2016):</span>\\n\\nLast day! It seemed the week went really quickly and I had mixed feelings about heading back home or wanting to stay! The last day was only a half a day\\n\\nAfter grabbing a coffee \u2013 it was straight into **Deploy, configure, and remotely manage Nano Server,** hosted by Benjamin Armstrong a Principle Program Manager at Microsoft this was definitely a good session! Last time I had stood up a Nano Server it was in technical preview and the provisioning of said Nano Server has come a long way \u2013definite project for the weekend to stand up Nano Server 2016 \u2013 Hyper-V host on my Intel NUC. Nano Server will follow the same update \u2018servicing model\u2019 as Windows 10 with feature updates roughly every year. Benjamin explained that not all Roles & Features are supported in Nano server and what and why they removed parts of Windows that we have taken for granted and that has become bloated over the years such as MSI and the Plug & Play engine. This operating system \u2013 severely reduces attack surface, disk image space and reduces the need for restarts during Windows updates! This platform is definitely worth looking into and they have paid allot of attention to the \u2018Voice of the Customer\u2019 in what the pain points are.\\n\\n<div style=\\"width: 403px\\" class=\\"wp-caption alignnone\\">\\n  <a href=\\"https://i2.wp.com/luke.geek.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image-5.png\\"><img title=\\"image\\" src=\\"https://i0.wp.com/luke.geek.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image_thumb-5.png?resize=393%2C298\\" alt=\\"Deploy, configure, and remotely manage Nano Server, hosted by Benjamin Armstrong\\" width=\\"393\\" height=\\"298\\" data-recalc-dims=\\"1\\" /></a>\\n  \\n  <p class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">\\n    Deploying Nano Server with Nano Guy!\\n  </p>\\n</div>\\n\\nAfter Nano server it was &#8211; **Migrating to Windows 10, make sure you don\u2019t end up with Windows 7 again** another presentation by Brendan Byrne &#8211; another interesting session! This session was all about making sure to use or at least consider the Windows 10 features \u2013 so you don\u2019t end up with a Windows 7 version of Windows 10 and miss out on modern features and security advancements made on the Desktop platform. There was also examples of a few companies who had deployed Windows 10 in different ways \u2013 1 using in Place Upgrade and another allowing Self-Service upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10, which allowed users to upgrade to Windows 10 on demand \u2013 reducing the IT resourcing requirement and user impact which was an interesting concept. Brendan also touched on Application Testing putting your applications into certain baskets \u2013 as not everything can be tested.\\n\\n**Discover -> Rationalize -> Prioritize -> Test**\\n\\nHe also touched on Windows as a Service and getting into the rhythm and managing it on a day to day basis \u2013 setting up the CB, CBB and Windows Insider rings inside the organization and using tools like UE-V and Enterprise State Roaming!\\n\\n> _\u201cIf people aren\u2019t more productive with just the OS along, how successful is the project?\u201d &#8211; Brendan Byrne_\\n\\nThe last session of the event \u2013 was **30 terrible habits of Server and Cloud Administrators** by Orin Thomas. This was a useful session regarding how lazy we as system administrations have become and how dangerous it is, such as Windows Firewall being disabled, passwords stored in an excel spreadsheet, Service accounts that are set to never expired and part of Domain Admin!\\n\\nUseful session that again I can get a lot of value and actions out of straight away!\\n\\n> _\u201cBuilders often live in unfinished houses?\u201d \u2013 Orin Thomas_\\n> \\n> _\u201cHack the nerd is simpler and often more effective than hack the system\u201d \u2013 Orin Thomas_\\n\\nAfter some Lunch \u2013 the event was over and was time to head back home! My time at Microsoft Ignite NZ 2016 was fun, valuable, eventful and just all round awesome! I thank Microsoft and all the Speakers and Sponsors for this event!

Hyper-V is currently available in Windows 8, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8.1 & Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2. The Hyper-V hypervisor allows multiple workloads to run on the same physical hardware that in the past would have otherwise only been suitable for one workload \u2013 allowing for power and resource efficiency.\\n\\n### Hyper-V Specifications\\n\\n**Host operating system:**\\n\\nTo install the Hyper-V role, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard, Enterprise or Datacentre edition, Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacentre edition, or Windows 8 (or 8.1) Pro or Enterprise edition is required. Hyper-V is only supported on x86-64 variants of Windows. It can be installed regardless of whether the installation is a full or core installation. **Processor:\xa0**An x86-64 processor\\n\\nHardware-assisted virtualization support: This is available in processors that include a virtualization option; specifically, Intel VT or AMD Virtualization (AMD-V, formerly code-named &#8220;Pacifica&#8221;).\\n\\nA NX bit-compatible CPU must be available and Hardware Data Execution Prevention (DEP) must be enabled.\\n\\nAlthough this is not an official requirement, Windows Server 2008 R2 and a CPU with second-level address translation support are recommended for workstations.\\n\\nSecond-level address translation is a mandatory requirement for Hyper-V in Windows 8\\n\\n**Memory**\\n\\nMinimum 2 GB. (Each virtual machine requires its own memory, and so realistically much more.)\\n\\nWindows Server 2008 Standard (x64) Hyper-V full GUI or Core supports up to 31 GB of memory for running VMs, plus 1 GB for the Hyper-V parent OS.]\\n\\nMaximum total memory per system for Windows Server 2008 R2 hosts: 32 GB (Standard) or 2 TB (Enterprise, Datacentre)\\n\\nMaximum total memory per system for Windows Server 2012 hosts: 4 TB\\n\\n### Guest operating systems\\n\\nHyper-V in Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 supports virtual machines with up to 4 processors each (1, 2, or 4 processors depending on guest OS-see below)\\n\\nHyper-V in Windows Server 2012 supports virtual machines with up to 64 processors each.\\n\\nHyper-V in Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 supports up to 384 VMs per system.\\n\\nHyper-V in Windows Server 2012 supports up to 1024 active virtual machines per system.\\n\\nHyper-V supports both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) guest VMs.\\n\\n#### Improvements of Hyper-V in Windows Server 2012\\n\\nHyper-V Extensible Virtual Switch\\n\\nNetwork virtualization\\n\\nMulti-tenancy\\n\\nStorage Resource Pools\\n\\n.vhdx disk format supporting virtual hard disks as large as 64 TB with power failure resiliency\\n\\nVirtual Fibre Channel\\n\\nOffloaded data transfer\\n\\nHyper-V replica\\n\\nCross-premise connectivity\\n\\nCloud backup\\n\\n#### Installing Hyper-V in Windows 8 & Windows 8.1\\n\\n  1. Navigate to **Control Panel** & select **Uninstall a Program** underneath programs\\n  2. Select **Turn Windows Features On or Off**\\n  3. Check **Hyper-V & Hyper-V Platform** and select additional relevant features \u2013 I would HIGHLY recommend Hyper-V GUI Management Tools.\\n  4. Windows will go through and install the Hyper-V modules onto the Windows 8 workstation. Once completed the workstation will need a restart and you will be able to now fully utilise Hyper-V!\\n\\n#### Installing Hyper-V for Windows Server 2012\\n\\n  1. Open **Server Manager**\\n  2. Click **Add Roles and Features** and click **Next**\\n  3. Select **Hyper-V Role** and click **Next**\\n  4. Select the appropriate NIC (network interface card) for live migration and select **Next**\\n  5. Select the default locations for your VHD (virtual hard disks) and VM (virtual machine) configuration files to be held and select **Next**\\n  6. Once the Hyper-V role has been fully installed \u2013 restart the Windows Server 2012 machine. You should now have access to the Hyper-V Manager.\\n\\n### Hyper-V Tips and Tricks\\n\\n#### How to stop and restart the Hyper-V service\\n\\n  1. Open **Hyper-V Manager**\\n  2. Select the relevant Hyper-V server\\n  3. Select Stop Service\\n\\n#### How to create a new Virtual Machine in Hyper-V\\n\\n  1. Open **Hyper-V Manager**\\n  2. Select **New** and **Virtual Machine**\\n  3. The before you Begin Wizard will now appear \u2013 click **Next**\\n  4. Choose a name for your Virtual Machine and verify the storage location is for the virtual machine is appropriate and click **Next**\\n  5. Here you can select the &#8220;generation&#8221; of the Virtual Machine.\\n  6. **Generation 1** \u2013 These are for 32bit legacy based systems usually used for Windows 7 and Windows XP/Linux virtual machines.\\n  7. **Generation 2** \u2013 These are for Windows Server 2012 or 64bit versions of Windows 8\\n  8. <em style=\\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium;\\">NOTE: Once Virtual Machine generation has been selected \u2013 YOU CANNOT change it.</em>\\n  9. <em style=\\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium;\\">NOTE: Using </em>Convert-VMGeneration <em style=\\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: medium;\\">script you can convert a Generation 1 VM to Generation 2.</em>\\n 10.

The hosted Branchcache server that is usually located closer to your physical location then the main fileserver \u2013 holds a &#8220;cached&#8221; copy which your computer will grab first. If no one had requested the &#8220;Untitled.docx&#8221; previously your Windows workstation will then retrieve the file from the main fileserver and the Branchcache server will then host the file for an amount of time \u2013 specified by your systems administrator \u2013 this allows faster read times on the files you are commonly working on and reduces overall network latency.\\n\\n#### Distributed\\n\\nBranchcache Distribution is a method in which there is no local branchcache server available. This method is commonly used for smaller external remote sites \u2013 compared to the hosted method which requires a server setup. Through the use of the Local Group Policy distributed branchcache allows you to retrieve commonly used documents from other branchcache supported Windows workstations without the use of a dedicated server.\\n\\nThe files get &#8220;cached&#8221; onto the local workstations \u2013 allowing any supported Branchcache workstation to pick up the cached files without having to download the files from the network fileserver \u2013 reducing the continuous pull from the network fileserver and allowing for faster start \u2013 this method however is not recommended in a highly secure environment as files are stored on the local workstations.\\n\\n_Note: Both methods do a file check to make sure the file version you are opening \u2013 is the most up to date. If the file you are opening is out of date \u2013 to the one stored on the fileserver then Branchcache will automatically run the latest version and update it&#8217;s cache._"},{"id":"/2014/01/12/help-manual-how-to-publish-to-epub","metadata":{"permalink":"/2014/01/12/help-manual-how-to-publish-to-epub","source":"@site/blog/2014-01-12-help-manual-how-to-publish-to-epub.md","title":"Help Manual How to publish to epub","description":"Help & Manual allows documents to be published to multiple formats \u2013 such as ePub & CHM easily.","date":"2014-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Windows","permalink":"/tags/windows"}],"readingTime":0.29,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Help Manual How to publish to epub","tags":["Windows"],"date":"2014-01-12 00:00:00 +1300"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The differences between Hosted and Distributed Branchcache","permalink":"/2014/01/13/the-differences-between-hosted-distributed-branchcache"},"nextItem":{"title":"VMWare Service Manager How to setup Watched Calls","permalink":"/2014/01/09/vmware-service-manager-how-to-setup-watched-calls"}},"content":"Help & Manual allows documents to be published to multiple formats \u2013 such as ePub & CHM easily.\\n\\n  1.

This is just the instructions for the install.\\n  \\nAttention:\\n\\n1- This DVD is designed for Intel architectures.\\n  \\nMinimum requirements: Intel SSE3 CPU, 512MB RAM, 12GB free space on target partition.\\n\\n2- This DVD includes Apple&#8217;s OS X Leopard 10.5.2 (9C7010) installation.\\n\\n3- Make sure that the md5 checksum of your iATKOS iso image matches the one posted on our website. Otherwise you may have a faulty DVD image. Use quality media/burner and burn slowly.\\n  \\nInformation:\\n\\n&#8211; This release supports GPT (Guid Partition Table) partition map scheme. You can change your partition table type to GPT via Disk Utility or some other partition managers. We advice Parted Magic Live CD which is based on GParted.\\n\\n&#8211; This release also includes Darwin EFI emulation boot for MBR (Master Boot Record) harddrives. Intel Core CPUs can use stock kernel and stock ACPIPlatform with EFI emulation on MBR and with GPT. This increases stability and performance.\\n\\n&#8211; Intel CoreDuo Processors have appropriate SpeedStep Technology which is stable in OS X. If you have such processor, you can enable throttling feature using the &#8220;SpeedStep&#8221; package which you can find under system drivers section. Note that speedstep kernel is included in iATKOS main system, so don&#8217;t select any of the kernels with speedstep support if you don&#8217;t want to have kernel panic.\\n\\n&#8211; There are some boot options for some various hardware. Boot DVD, press F8 and enter:\\n  \\nnforce -v\\n  \\nfor nForce motherboards with intel SSE3 CPU\\n  \\nnforce_core -v\\n  \\nfor nForce motherboards with Intel Core CPU\\n  \\ntoh -v\\n  \\nfor booting with ToH 9.2.0 kernel which works nice on many types of hardware\\n  \\nInstallation:\\n\\n1- Run Disk Utility via Utilities menu and erase the target partition for clean install. Do partitioning if you need to.\\n\\na- You can choose MBR (Master Boot Record) or GPT (Guid Partition Table) via partitioning options. If you want to change your existing partition table type, know that all your existing data on disk will be gone.\\n  \\nb- For Windows fellows that has not tested this amazing system yet and that does not want to loose their windows software, porn and virus&trojan archive on D:, should use Parted Magic Live CD for preparing an active primary target partition and after that, just erase it via diskutil. Jump to Step 2.\\n\\n2- Select the destination for installation.\\n\\n3- Click customize and select what you need.\\n\\n4- Click Install.\\n\\nInstall time is about 20 minutes.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nMultiboot:\\n\\niATKOS 2.0i has no integrated procedure for multibooting but preparing a multiboot GPT or MBR system with this release is easier than ever.\\n\\nHere is a &#8221;How To&#8221; for GPT and MBR triple boot including Mac-Vista-Linux.\\n\\n&#8211; MBR (Master Boot Record) triple boot &#8211;\\n\\n&#8211; Change your partition table type to MBR (msdos type) and create 3 primary partitions by using Parted Magic Live CD or iATKOS Disk Utility. HFS+ format for OS X target, Fat32 for the others.\\n  \\nNote: %99.99999 of the PC harddrives already have MBR partition map scheme (msdos type) which you can change it to GPT via Parted Magic CD or iATKOS Disk Utility if you like to.\\n\\n&#8211; Add boot flag to Vista or Linux target and install the OS&#8217; in any order you like. For linux, do not install bootloader to MBR, install it to linux root.\\n\\n&#8211; Boot iATKOS 2.0i DVD and install OS X to its target as usual.\\n\\n&#8211; Now you need to repair Vista. Add boot flag to Vista partition, boot Vista DVD, select repair, add boot flag to OS X partition, thats all.\\n\\nNow you have triple boot on MBR.\\n\\nNote: Adding boot flag to MBR partitions: Boot Parted Magic Live CD, right click to partition, select flags and click to boot.\\n\\n&#8211; GPT (Guid Partition Table) triple boot &#8211;\\n\\n&#8211; Change your partition table type to GPT (Guid Partition Table) and create 3 partitions by using Parted Magic Live CD or iATKOS Disk Utility. HFS+ format for OS X target, Fat32 (msdos) for the others.\\n\\n&#8211; Boot iATKOS 2.0i DVD, install only bootloader to OS X target. \\\\***\\n\\n&#8211; Boot Vista DVD and install it to first Fat32 partition.\\n  \\n(Note: System marks first Fat32 partition or booting Foreign OS&#8217;. If you choose other than first Fat32 as target for Vista, then during installation, system will not continue install process at first Vista boot.)\\n\\n&#8211; Boot Linux media and install the OS. Install the bootloader to linux root.\\n  \\n(Note: Some live linux cd stuff (knoppix, kanotix, parsix etc.) has built-in installer applications and they use gparted for partitioning and formatting targets. At this point, formatting target to linux fs via Gparted is not a good choice, use fdisk just for changing the target partition type from &#8221;c0&#8221; to &#8221;83&#8221; which is linux partition type and then continue installation.)\\n\\n&#8211; Boot iATKOS 2.0i DVD and install OS X as usual.\\n\\nNow you have triple boot on GPT, thats all.\\n\\nAs you see, preparing multiboot system on GPT is more practical and easier.\\n  \\nDarwin on GPT will see other OS&#8217; as Foreign Boot.\\n\\n\\\\*** For pro-users: You can re-install Darwin bootloader by booting the iATKOS DVD with -s. Boot with -s and enter darwin command, follow the instructions. For MBR HD, you can add boot flag via fdisk after darwin installation.\\n  \\nKnown Issues:\\n\\n1- Jmicron IDE controllers are known to have issues with OS X.\\n\\n2- Some 965 chipset MSI and ASUS motherboards (desktop and laptop) have issues with this OS. ACPI errors while booting with DVD and also with hd. There will be patches for those uncompatible devices and there is also a patch for 1.0ir2.\\n\\n3- This dvd may not include all the necessary drivers required by your setup. Additional steps may be needed to be taken by the user to setup and use such components.\\n\\n4- Be sure that the labels of your hfs+ partitions are not similar. ie. Mac 1, MacOS or Leopard X, Leopard Y. Installer may fail to determine the target partition to install the system if the labels match.\\n  \\nUnsuccessful Installation and Related Symptoms:\\n  \\n1- I get the error &#8220;com.apple.Boot.plist is not found&#8221; while booting the DVD\\n\\n&#8211;> You are probably trying to boot from an unsupported controller.\\n  \\n~ You should use usb dvd rom drive, or you may need sata-ide convertor for your dvd rom drive (jmicron).\\n\\n2- System freezes at grey screen by booting the DVD.\\n\\n&#8211;> You probably have an unsupported chipset.\\n  \\n*965 chipset ASUS or MSI motherboard/laptop\\n  \\n*many VIA, SIS, ATI chipset motherboards\\n  \\n~ Change your hardware\\n  \\n~ A patch can be possible for 965 ASUS/MSI hardware, so keep on watching this community.\\n\\n\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\****\\n\\nFor additional Help and instructions, here is the website and irc channel.\\n\\nweb: http://www.uphuck.com\\n  \\nIRC: irc.atlantis-irc.net #uphuck.DVD #osx86.turk\\n\\n\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***\\\\***"},{"id":"/2012/03/31/igxprd32","metadata":{"permalink":"/2012/03/31/igxprd32","source":"@site/blog/2012-03-31-igxprd32.md","title":"igxprd32 display driver has stopped working","description":"&#8220;igxprd32 display driver has stopped working&#8221;","date":"2012-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Windows","permalink":"/tags/windows"}],"readingTime":0.22,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"igxprd32 display driver has stopped working","permalink":"/win/igxprd32/","tags":["Windows"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"iATKOS v2.0i Installation","permalink":"/2012/03/31/iatkos-v2-0i-installation"},"nextItem":{"title":"Using MKVMerge to add subtitles","permalink":"/2012/03/31/using-mkvmerge"}},"content":"&#8220;igxprd32 display driver has stopped working&#8221;\\n\\nThis issue occurs due to a bug with the drivers, in order to repair this issue you have to rollback to a previous driver.\\n\\nThe Intel <a title=\\"Driver_Download\\" href=\\"http://www.bootwin.com/dell-drivers/dell-inspiron-1420-intel-gm965-express-chipset-family-x.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">6.14.10.4926 A06</a> drivers appear to be the most stable."},{"id":"/2012/03/31/using-mkvmerge","metadata":{"permalink":"/2012/03/31/using-mkvmerge","source":"@site/blog/2012-03-31-using-mkvmerge.md","title":"Using MKVMerge to add subtitles","description":"1.
