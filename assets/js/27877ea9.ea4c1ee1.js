This session details using Just in Time Administration \u2013 Privileged Access Management which is a technology by Microsoft that utilizes Microsoft Identity Manager, to have a one-way forest trust with a privileged forest.

The idea is no one is a member of an AD group unless they actually need it and then for a certain amount of time. This would work in well with Change Control, as part of the implementation steps you need to figure out how long the Change would be and add in a step to request the specified access for the time of that action that is then automatically removed. PAM supports any Active Directory group which is also handy \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to be an Active Directory Built-in group!
