all mean? What is the difference between them, and when should you use them?</p>
<p>Today, we are going to take a look at a technical Cloud Product Development lifecycle - in my eyes, understanding these terminologies is key to determining:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of resources <em>(i.e., both technological and human)</em> do you need to dedicate to a product?</li>
<li>Where should you align lifecycle management with your application or service?</li>
<li>How likely is it that the the product makes a good market fit or solves an issue?</li>
<li>Keep your product lean to avoid wasting the wrong resources at the wrong time</li>
<li>Shift to a product-based mindset</li>
<li>Focus on innovation and early feedback loops</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course - what to expect when people start using these words, often thrown together in a conversation and sometimes even put in writing in Statement of Works and Requests for Proposals.</p>
<!-- -->
<h1>üé® Design Thinking and Agile</h1>
<p>Using Design Thinking - <em>(Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test, Implement)</em> as a base - a Product needs to align with actual customer needs; it&#x27;s an iterative process, as a Product or service itself isn&#x27;t static. We live in a VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) world, where customers expect more from their technology <em>(as they should)</em> to help empower their own needs securely and reliably.</p>
<p>Agile is about the speed to adapt, not the velocity to deliver, so if we take in Agile delivery and design thinking methodologies, it is no surprise that we need to break the product lifecycle into specific stages to get faster, more immediate feedback and make sure we are concentrating on the right success metrics for our product at the right time.</p>
