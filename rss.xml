<p>Three crucial aspects of API governance and usage play a significant role in achieving success:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Façade Abstraction</strong>
This concept involves creating an interface that simplifies and standardizes how APIs interact with backend systems.
Aggregate or Slice: APIs can aggregate data from multiple sources or slice it into meaningful pieces for specific use cases. This flexibility allows businesses to present data in the most relevant and valuable way to their users.
Normalize or Modernize: Façade Abstraction also helps normalize or modernize legacy systems, making them compatible with modern applications. This allows you to extend the life of older systems and integrate them with new technologies without extensive rework.
Decouple Lifecycle Mock: Decoupling the API lifecycle from the backend systems ensures that changes in backend services do not disrupt the API functionality. Mocking services during the development and testing phases further ensures smooth transitions and updates.</li>
<li><strong>Front Door Control</strong>
This aspect is about managing and controlling how APIs are accessed and utilized.
Route and Accelerate: You can optimize your applications' performance and responsiveness by routing API requests efficiently. Acceleration techniques like caching and load balancing can significantly improve user experience.
Secure and Protect: Security is paramount in API management. Front Door Control involves implementing robust security measures to protect APIs from threats and unauthorized access. These measures include authentication, authorization, and data encryption.
Transform and Observe: Transforming API requests and responses to meet specific requirements and observing API usage patterns helps maintain control and ensure optimal performance. Monitoring tools provide insights into how APIs are being used and can alert you to potential issues before they become critical.</li>
<li><strong>Frictionless Consumption</strong>
This principle is about making it easy for developers and users to discover, access, and use your APIs.
Onboarding: A smooth onboarding process is crucial for attracting and retaining users. Clear documentation, tutorials, and support help users quickly understand and start using your APIs.
Discover and Learn: APIs should be easily discoverable. A well-organized developer portal where users can learn about the available APIs, their functionalities, and use cases can achieve this.
Try and Obtain Access: Allowing users to try APIs in a sandbox environment and easily obtain access through streamlined registration encourages experimentation and adoption.</li>

<p>Now that we have imported and tested an existing API, let's consider designing a new one.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Design a API" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_design_designaapi-a8683536c660e8a0c0c94ca27a4a3df5.png" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Azure offers powerful resources to streamline and enhance our workflow.</p>
<p>Defining the API:</p>
<p>First, let's talk about defining our API. Azure provides two main approaches:</p>
<p>Form-Based Editors:</p>
<p>These editors are highly intuitive, offering a user-friendly interface to input all necessary details about your API.
Perfect for those who prefer a guided, step-by-step setup.</p>
<p>Text-Based Editors:</p>
<p>For those more comfortable with coding, Azure allows us to edit the API definition directly in JSON format.
This method offers greater flexibility and control over the API specifications.</p>
<p>Visual Studio Code Extension:</p>
<p>In addition to the Azure portal, you can also leverage the Visual Studio Code extension. This extension integrates seamlessly with Azure, allowing you to manage and define your APIs directly within your development environment. It's an excellent tool for developers who prefer to work locally.</p>
<p>Testing the API:</p>
<p>Once the API is defined, the next crucial step is testing. Azure simplifies this process in several ways:</p>
<p>Azure Portal Testing:
You can test your API directly within the Azure portal. This feature lets you ensure everything functions correctly without switching between multiple tools.
Schema Generation:
Azure can generate schemas from your API responses. These schemas provide a clear structure of your API's data, ensuring that both developers and consumers understand the expected input and output formats.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Mock API" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_design_mockapi-b84e58f8c6ec4e7661ed0a65692f0946.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Adopting a design-first approach can significantly enhance efficiency and collaboration. One technique we can utilize is mocking the API. Let's explore how this approach can benefit our development workflow.</p>
<p>Design-First Approach - Mock the API:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unblock Front-End Teams:</li>
</ol>
<p>Mocking API responses is a game-changer for front-end developers.
Providing predefined responses enables front-end teams to continue their development work without waiting for the back-end to be fully implemented.
This leads to parallel development, reducing bottlenecks and speeding up the overall project timeline.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use an Example Defined in the API Definition:</li>
</ol>
<p>The process starts with defining an example response within the API definition.
This predefined response acts as a placeholder, simulating the actual API behavior.
It ensures that front-end teams have consistent and reliable data to work with during the early stages of development.
3. Configure with a Single-Line Policy:</p>
<p>One of Azure API Management's standout features is the ability to configure mocking with a simple, single-line policy.</p>
<p>As shown in the example on the image, the policy can be written as:</p>
<div class="language-xml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-xml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">&lt;</span><span class="token tag" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">inbound</span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">&gt;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">&lt;</span><span class="token tag" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">base</span><span class="token tag" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)"> </span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">/&gt;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">&lt;</span><span class="token tag" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">mock-response</span><span class="token tag" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)"> </span><span class="token tag attr-name" style="color:rgb(241, 250, 140)">status-code</span><span class="token tag attr-value punctuation attr-equals" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">=</span><span class="token tag attr-value punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">"</span><span class="token tag attr-value" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">200</span><span class="token tag attr-value punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">"</span><span class="token tag" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)"> </span><span class="token tag attr-name" style="color:rgb(241, 250, 140)">content-type</span><span class="token tag attr-value punctuation attr-equals" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">=</span><span class="token tag attr-value punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">"</span><span class="token tag attr-value" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">application/json</span><span class="token tag attr-value punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">"</span><span class="token tag" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)"> </span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">/&gt;</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">&lt;/</span><span class="token tag" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">inbound</span><span class="token tag punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Cross Domain policies" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_design_crossdomainpolicy-dee621e36fc6a851c601b6f649becdea.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Policy Scopes</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Policy Scopes" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_design_policyscopes-798c598ad09cebfb296141546877fe55.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Let's examine the policy scopes. Understanding the scope is crucial to applying the right policy in the right place. Policies are inherited from the parent scope to the child scope.</p>
<p>So let us go through them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Global <em>(Red Border)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Description: Global policies apply to all requests and responses passing through the API Management instance. They are the outermost scope, impacting every operation, API, and product.
Usage: Commonly used for policies like CORS <em>(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)</em> and logging, which should be consistent across the entire API Management instance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Workspace <em>(Yellow Border)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Description: This scope is associated with a workspace, which groups related APIs and other components within API Management.
Usage: Policies defined at this level are used when consistent policy enforcement is needed across multiple APIs belonging to the same workspace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Product <em>(Green Border)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Description: Product-level policies apply to all APIs included within a specific product. Products are a way to bundle APIs together for subscription and access management.
Usage: Common for setting rate limits and quotas that apply to all APIs in the product, helping to manage usage and prevent abuse.</p>
<ul>
<li>API <em>(Blue Border)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Description: API-level policies apply to all operations within a specific API. This scope allows for API-wide behavior customization.
Usage: Often used for API-specific security measures like JWT (JSON Web Token) validation or other API-wide configurations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Operation <em>(Purple Border)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Description: Operation-level policies are the most granular and apply to a specific operation within an API <em>(e.g., a single endpoint or method)</em>.
Usage: Useful for operation-specific requirements like caching, URL rewriting, or request/response transformation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inbound and Outbound policies</li>
</ul>
<p>Inbound policies are applied as the request comes in from the caller, and outbound policies are applied as the response is sent back to the caller after being processed by the backend.</p>
<p>Each of these scopes allows for different levels of customization and control over how requests and responses are handled within Azure API Management.</p>
<p>If we take a look at the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-properties?tabs=azure-portal&amp;WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">policy named values</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-policy-expressions?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expressions</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Policy Values" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_design_policysvalues-a699bb0fcc072978e1873e5c20effd9d.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We can see that Named Values are a powerful feature in Azure API Management that allows us to define reusable variables and secrets that can be used across policies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Policies are a collection of statements that are executed sequentially on the request or response of an API. Policy statements can be constructed using literal text values, policy expressions, and named values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Named values are a global collection of name/value pairs in each API Management instance. There is no imposed limit on the number of items in the collection. Named values can be used to manage constant string values and secrets across all API configurations and policies.</p>
<p>Lets take a look at some out of the box policies</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Out of the box policies" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_design_outoftheboxpolicies-5282f68c21386cddf8904f61e5df4f1e.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Azure API Management includes, "Out of the box policies" provides the majority of use cases that that can be implemented to manage access, transform data, advance functionalities, integrate with Dapr, authenticate users, cache data, manage cross-domain calls, and validate information.</p>
<p>Let us delve into each category to understand the capabilities these policies offer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access Restriction</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Access restriction policies are crucial for controlling who can access your services and how often. These policies include:</p>
<p>Check HTTP header: Validates headers in HTTP requests.
Limit call rate by subscription/key: Controls the rate of API calls based on the subscription or key.
Restrict caller IPs: Allows access only from specified IP addresses.
Set usage quota by subscription/key: Limits the usage based on subscription or key.
Validate client certificate: Ensures the authenticity of the client via certificates.
Validate JWT (JSON Web Token): Verifies the token to ensure secure access.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transformation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Transformation policies handle the modification and conversion of data formats and content. These policies include:</p>
<p>Convert JSON to XML / XML to JSON: Transforms data between JSON and XML formats.
Find and replace string in body: Replaces specific strings in the request or response body.
Mask URLs in content: Hides sensitive URLs within the content.
Set backend service/body/HTTP header/query string parameter: Customizes backend service configurations and request parameters.
Rewrite URL: Modifies the URL of incoming requests.
Transform XML using XSLT: Applies XSLT to transform XML data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced policies provide extended functionalities for handling requests and responses. These include:</p>
<p>Send one-way request / request: Facilitates sending HTTP requests.
Set HTTP proxy / request method / status code / variable: Configures proxy, method, status code, and variables.
Control flow / Emit metric: Manages the flow of requests and emits metrics.
Log to Event Hub / Trace: Logs events and traces for monitoring.
Mock response / Forward request: Creates mock responses or forwards requests.
Limit concurrency / Return response / Retry / Wait: Manages concurrency, responses, and retry mechanisms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dapr Integration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) integration policies enable communication with Dapr services:</p>
<p>Send request to a service / message to a pub/subtopic: Facilitates interaction with Dapr services and pub/subtopics.
Trigger output binding: Initiates output bindings in Dapr.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Authentication policies ensure that only authorized users can access your services:</p>
<p>Authenticate with basic / client certificate / managed identity: Supports various authentication methods to verify user identity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Caching</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Caching policies improve performance by storing and retrieving data from the cache:</p>
<p>Store to cache / Get value from cache / Store value from cache / Remove value from cache: Manages caching operations to optimize data retrieval.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross Domain</strong>
Cross-domain policies handle calls across different domains:</li>
</ul>
<p>CORS / JSON: Manages cross-origin resource sharing and JSON data handling.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validation Policies</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Validation policies ensure the integrity and correctness of data:</p>
<p>Validate content/parameters/headers/status code / GraphQL request: Check the validity of content, parameters, headers, status codes, and GraphQL requests.</p>
<p>An example of policies that are useful is <strong>Request Forwarding</strong>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Policy Example" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_design_outoftheboxpolicies_RequestForwarding-16185468fc02efa145d2c8fe3fdb3017.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This policy is usually inherited from the global scope via the </p><base> tag. If no specific policy is set, it defaults to the base configuration.
Timeout Settings: The forwarding timeout can be configured between 30 seconds to 10 minutes, with the default being 5 minutes.
Redirect Handling: It can be configured to follow redirects or, by default, return them to the caller.<p></p>
<ul>
<li>You can configure Retry (<retry></retry>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Triggering Conditions: Retry is triggered when a specified expression evaluates to true.
Backoff Intervals: Offers options for fixed, linear, or exponential backoff intervals.
Fast First Retry: An optional feature for a quick retry attempt.
Request Copy: Does not retain a copy of the request automatically, ensuring efficient resource utilization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit Concurrency (<limit-concurrency></limit-concurrency>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Concurrency Cap: Caps the number of concurrent requests forwarded to the backend to prevent overloading.
Policy Integration: Can be used in conjunction with other policies to limit the number of requests entering enclosed policies.
Set Backend Service (<set-backend-service></set-backend-service>)</p>
<p>Runtime Changes: Allows changing the backend service during runtime, providing flexibility in managing backend services.
Conditional Policies: Can be configured with conditional policies for blue/green deployment, ensuring smooth transitions and updates.</p>
<p>and Authentication (<authentication></authentication>)</p>

<p>Azure API Management provides a range of security features to protect APIs from these threats.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at securing the different planes of Azure API Management.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - APIM Planes" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_secure_planes-0ea6cbc8bcb55e476bb51c8bc191abeb.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>In today's interconnected digital landscape, securing backend APIs is paramount. One key strategy for achieving this is through robust data plane security. This layered defense mechanism protects sensitive data and applications from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. Let's delve deeper into how data plane security works and the roles of its components.</p>
<p><strong>Firewall: Blocking Suspicious Requests</strong></p>
<p>The first line of defense in data plane security is the firewall. It acts as a gatekeeper, scrutinizing incoming requests to block any that appear suspicious. The firewall employs several rule sets and mechanisms to identify and mitigate potential threats:</p>
<ul>
<li>OWASP Core Rule Sets: These are standardized rules for detecting common web application security risks.</li>
<li>Bot Protection Rule Set: This helps in identifying and blocking automated bot traffic that could pose security risks.</li>
<li>Custom Rules: Organizations can define their own rules tailored to their specific security requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gateway: Authenticating and Authorizing Requests</strong></p>
<p>Once a request passes through the firewall, it reaches the gateway. The gateway is responsible for performing in-depth request authentication and authorization to ensure only valid requests proceed. Key functions of the gateway include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication Mechanisms: OAuth 2, client certificates, and custom authentication methods.</li>
<li>Authorization Mechanisms: Including IP filtering and custom authorization rules.</li>
<li>Request/Response Validation: Ensuring that both incoming requests and outgoing responses meet predefined security criteria.</li>
<li>Throttling: Managing the rate of incoming requests to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Backend APIs: Fine-Grained Authorization</strong></p>
<p>The final layer involves the backend APIs themselves, which must accept requests only from trusted sources. This layer applies fine-grained authorization to enforce strict access controls. Key security measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP Basic (Shared Secret): Simple but effective method for authenticating requests.</li>
<li>Mutual Certificates: Ensuring both client and server authenticate each other.</li>
<li>OAuth 2: Secure token-based authentication.</li>
<li>Managed Identity and IP Filtering: This involves restricting access based on IP addresses and managing identities to enforce security policies.</li>
<li>Private Networking: Isolating the APIs within a secure network environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Azure API Management has two networking options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal</li>
<li>External</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-using-with-internal-vnet?tabs=stv2&amp;WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal</a> option is more secure, as it is not exposed to the public internet. It is ideal for scenarios where you want to restrict access to your APIs to only internal clients or services.

<p>You can also use the best of both worlds by allowing Azure API Management in Internal mode to publish APIs to the Internet or external customers and using Azure Front Door or Azure Application Gateway to expose the APIs to the Internet.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Internal with WAF" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_secure_internalwaf-f13da5e00ddbbdc68805301204d404b4.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Deciding between using Azure API Management (APIM) in Internal or External mode depends on your specific requirements for security, accessibility, and network configuration. Here are some key considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal Mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Accessibility: The APIM endpoints are accessible only from within the Virtual Network (VNet) via an internal load balancer.
Security: This mode is more secure as it restricts access to the APIM endpoints to only those resources within the VNet.
Use Case: This is ideal for scenarios where you need to protect sensitive APIs and ensure that they are only accessible from within your organization’s network.</p>
<ul>
<li>External Mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Accessibility: The APIM endpoints are accessible from the public internet via an external load balancer.
Security: While still secure, this mode allows for broader access, including from the internet.
Use Case: Suitable for scenarios where you must expose APIs to external clients or partners.</p>
<p>Deciding between Internal and External modes depends on your specific requirements and use case. Consider your APIs' security, accessibility, and network configuration needs to determine the best mode for your scenario.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Security Requirements: Internal mode is preferable if your APIs handle sensitive data.
Accessibility Needs: If you need to provide access to external clients, external mode is the way to go.
Network Configuration: Consider your existing network setup and how APIM will integrate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM Compliance" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_secure_compliance-61bc71cb1f56cbd5a74479627c54648a.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Multi-region" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_Multiregion-0e2e7c23dce94b1c00a01ce868718b69.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Azure API Management's multi-region deployment offers a robust solution for improving API reliability and reducing latency. Let's dive into the key features and benefits of this setup.
Improved Availability and Reduced Latency</p>
<p>One of the standout features of Azure API Management's multi-region deployment is the significantly improved availability of the data plane. You can expect minimal downtime with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99% compared to the standard 99.95%. This increased reliability ensures that your APIs remain accessible to users worldwide, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalability Across Multiple Regions</li>
</ul>
<p>A single Premium instance of Azure API Management can be scaled across multiple regions. This flexibility allows you to deploy additional units into the primary or secondary regions based on your needs. However, regions and units come at an additional cost. This scalability ensures that your API infrastructure can grow alongside your business demands.</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary and Secondary Regions</li>
</ul>
<p>In a multi-region deployment, the primary region hosts all components, including the gateway, developer portal, management API, and developer portal API. If the primary region becomes unavailable, these components are inaccessible, highlighting the importance of a robust primary region setup.</p>
<p>On the other hand, secondary regions host only the gateway. These secondary gateways can operate on the last received configuration while the primary area is unavailable. They periodically try to reconnect and catch up, ensuring that API requests continue to be processed even during primary region outages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Global API Availability</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most significant advantages of multi-region deployment is that all APIs are available in every region. Azure Traffic Manager plays a crucial role in routing requests to the closest available region in this setup. Using Traffic Manager’s performance routing with a 5-minute Time-to-Live (TTL), API requests are efficiently managed, reducing latency and improving response times for users worldwide.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Multi-Region Example" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_MultiregionEExample-676cd55575626c8fc3d3a5ad58e06340.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Lets take a look at the nuances on the anatomy of an Azure API Management instance.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Anatomy" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_AnatomyAPIM-c63666f907fc47e4c67abd2488e01422.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>An Azure API Management instance with 1 unit, represented by two machines (Machine #1 and Machine #2). Each machine has a set of components that work together to manage and secure APIs.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Machine</th><th>Component</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Machine #1</td><td>Control-Plane</td><td>The administrative interface for configuring and managing APIs and policies.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Gateway</td><td>Handles API requests and applies rate limiting and authentication policies.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Developer Portal</td><td>Customizable portal for developers to discover, learn, and use APIs.</td></tr><tr><td>Machine #2</td><td>Control-Plane</td><td>Redundant administrative interface for high availability.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Gateway</td><td>Redundant API Gateway for load balancing and fault tolerance.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Developer Portal</td><td>Another instance of the Developer Portal to ensure high availability.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>This is a typical setup of an Azure API Management instance. It emphasizes redundancy and high availability by distributing core components (Control-Plane, Gateway, and Developer Portal) across multiple machines. This setup ensures the API management service remains operational even if one machine fails.</p>
<p>However, to ensure high availability and disaster recovery, one may want to expand the Azure API Management instance to another region.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Scale" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_AnatomyAPIMSecondRegion-f223eb30d4dba49d7cb4bbf5d2d90e21.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When you scale an Azure API Management instance to another region, you are essentially creating a secondary region deployment. This setup provides high availability and disaster recovery capabilities, ensuring your APIs remain accessible even during a regional outage by expanding the Gateway service. All Control planet traffic and the developer portal are still managed by the primary region, however your APIs will still function.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Availability Zones" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_AvaliabilityZone-d4ef68e4c9fcf5423cf2c986990752fa.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>By deploying your APIM instance across two or more Availability Zones within a single region, you can achieve a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99%.
In a multi-region deployment, using Availability Zones can enhance the resiliency of the primary region. Even if one zone experiences an outage, the services can operate seamlessly from another zone within the same region.</p>
<p>Every unit deployed across the Availability Zones includes all necessary API Management components, ensuring comprehensive coverage and functionality.</p>
<p>Using Availability Zones in Azure API Management provides enhanced availability, reliability, and resiliency for your API services, especially in a multi-region deployment. This setup ensures that your APIs remain accessible and operational even in the face of regional outages or disruptions.</p>
<p>Now, let us take a look at self-hosting your own Gateway.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Self-hosted Gateway" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_SelfHostedAPIGateway-9a3b77f802ab4dcc77bc9434140378be.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The self-hosted API gateway is functionally equivalent to the managed gateway. This feature provides flexibility, allowing the gateway to be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, depending on the organization's needs. The self-hosted gateway requires only outgoing connectivity to Azure <em>(API Management Gateway)</em> on port 443.</p>
<p>The self-hosted gateway connects to a "parent" API Management service in Azure. It pulls down configuration settings and pushes up telemetry data to Azure. This integration with Azure allows for centralized management and monitoring, simplifying the oversight and control of the API gateway.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM - Self-hosted Gateway SKU" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_apilifecyle_scale_SelfHostedAPIGatewaySKU-6afdcfffadc0a6ac9e966f5bd4f8ad91.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Now, let us take a look at <a href="https://dapr.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dapr</a> and Azure API Management.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dapr can work with self-hosted Azure API Management gateways and invoke services running in different pods. This allows for seamless communication between microservices within the Kubernetes cluster.</li>
<li>Dapr supports publish/subscribe messaging, enabling applications to send messages to topics and other applications to subscribe to these topics</li>
<li>Dapr can trigger outbound bindings, which allows it to interact with external systems and services. This feature is useful for integrating with external databases, message queues, and other services.</li>
</ul>
<p>By integrating Dapr with self-hosted gateways, the architecture's complexity is reduced, and common tasks like service discovery, state management, and pub/sub are simplified.</p>
<p>Azure API Management offers an isolated SKU, a dedicated instance of Azure API Management that runs on a single-tenant virtual network. This SKU is ideal for organizations that require enhanced security, compliance, and isolation for their APIs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When working with Microsoft Azure, you may want an environment for learning, testing, or Hackathons. This post will cover some technical implementation considerations for creating a sandbox environment in Azure that could be used for your Hackathons using Terraform, Entra ID Access packages, and GitHub Actions.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Microsoft Azure - Hackathon" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/hackathon_overview-68a98616da8e81ab9fe921e6f2fc0e3a.png" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So let us look at a scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As a hackathon organizer, I want to build an Azure environment that supports various AI-driven solutions to automate and enhance operational processes, including customer feedback analysis, testing plan creation, and standard procedure refinement."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Hackathon - Requirements" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/hackathon_requirements-1d6c7bbc58eddc063d7e0b34b9c5720c.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We have a few Technical Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It needs to support multiple <em>(external)</em> users and teams from different organizations using Work and Personal accounts who work together.</li>
<li>Needs to support the creation of multiple Azure resources</li>
</ul>
<p>And our limitations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>One Azure subscription</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us look at how we can leverage Microsoft Azure technologies to implement this.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Hackathon - Azure environment" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/hackathon_environmenttech-564e79187f0a99533670876d61a40f67.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Subscription</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#resource-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Resource Groups</a> <em>(within Azure subscription)</em></li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/whatis?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entra ID</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entra ID Identity Governance - Access Packages</a>. This requires a Entra ID P2 license.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this article, there are some assumptions I will be making, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Resource Group per Team is sufficient for the Hackathon.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Hackathon - Environment concepts" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/hackathon_environmentconcepts-6e9d88470c62e51b3b951e5713fe6bfd.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>We will approach this as a <a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/microsoft-azure-sandbox-design-considerations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lightly Managed Sandbox</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Hackathon - Sandbox Types" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/hackathon_sandboxtypes-b9154dc64e946394357ff70eca29f46d.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>And give External Identities access to an Azure subscription through Access Packages and a Group with a Contributor role assigned to the individual Resource Groups.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Hackathon - Identity &amp;amp; Access" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/hackathon_identityaccess-7705a603b81cf5c9fb64db289058179d.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>To do this, we will leverage Access packages to invite external users into the Hackathon tenancy and assign them to a group with the Contributor role assigned to the Resource Group.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Hackthon - Access packages" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/hackathon_identityaccesspackages-111a83f65e10bb6219d52889d8f38830.PNG" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>By creating a Policy allowing external organizations to make requests, the Hackathon Organiser can invite external users to the Azure subscription and access internal <em>(Hackathon)</em> resources.</p>

<p>You will create a Resource Group, such as below, for each team based on the CSV file:</p>

<p>So now, we have created the Resource Groups and Entra ID groups and assigned Owner permissions to the Resource Groups for each Team in the CSV file; it is time to deploy a base resource - such as Azure OpenAI, which those hackathon teams can use, to get going! <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure OpenAI models are deployed to various regions</a> and have token limits constrained to the region, so we need to consider how heavily these endpoints will be hit - which is why you may have noticed in the CSV, that the location of each Resource Group is different, so we want to use that to make sure that our Azure OpenAI resources are deployed in the same region as the Resource Group, to help balance.</p>

<p>So we can create a map of the Resource Providers, and then iterate over them, to register them.</p>

<p>The Terraform backend settings look like this, with the state file stored in an Azure Storage account called tfstatehackathon in a container called tfstate in the rg-terraform-hackathon-prod Resource Group. These resources were manually deployed:</p>

<p>The full code for this can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/lukemurraynz/HackathonRGAzureEnvironment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lukemurraynz/HackathonRGAzureEnvironment</a>. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open a PR <em>(Pull Request)</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, once the Hackathon is over, you can use Terraform to revert the configuration and clean up the Azure subscription; once the users are removed from the Hackathon Access packages, their Guest accounts can be Disabled; you can also configure the policy to remove them from your tenancy automatically.</p>
<p>Your Hackathon students should now be able to log in to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-request-access?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#sign-in-to-the-my-access-portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My Access Portal</a>, request access, to a Team, and once approved <em>(based on the policy you specified in the Access package)</em> will be able to navigate to the Azure Portal for your tenancy '<a href="https://portal.azure.com/YOURTENANTNAMEORID" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portal.azure.com/YOURTENANTNAMEORID</a>' and be able to create resources in the Azure Resource Group, and as Teams expand, you simply have to edit the CSV file and push the change.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://project-copacetic.github.io/copacetic/website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copacetic</a> (or Copa for short) is a CLI tool written in Go and based on buildkit that can be used to directly patch container images given the vulnerability scanning results from popular tools like <a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trivy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trivy</a> is a security scanner that can scan container images for vulnerabilities. It is a simple and comprehensive scanner that can be used to scan images for vulnerabilities in the OS packages, application dependencies, and language-specific packages, supplemented by vulnerability databases supplemented with Copa, which can be used to patch the vulnerabilities found by Trivy; this tool can be used to quickly patch container images without going upstream for a full rebuild, which may require more time, and the involvement of multiple teams <em>(ie Developers, Q&amp;A, Operations, Support)</em> to patch, test and deploy.</p>
<p>In this article, we will use <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure DevOps</a> to run a pipeline that will use <a href="https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trivy</a> to scan a container image for vulnerabilities, and then use <a href="https://project-copacetic.github.io/copacetic/website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copa</a> to patch the vulnerabilities found by Trivy, and then push the patched image to an <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/container-registry?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Container Registry (ACR)</a>.</p>

<li>Allows users other than the image publishers also to patch container images, such as DevSecOps engineers.</li>
<li>Reduces the storage and transmission costs of redistributing patched images by only creating an additional patch layer instead of rebuilding the entire image, which usually results in different layer hashes that break layer caching.</li>
<li>Reduces the turnaround time for patching a container image by not having to wait for base image updates and being a faster operation than a full image rebuild.</li>
<li>Reduces the complexity of patching the image from running a rebuild pipeline to running a single tool on the image.</li>

<li>Copa supports patching existing container images <em>(Devs don't need to build their images using specific tools or modify them in some way to support container patching)</em>.</li>
<li>Copa supports containers without package managers, including distro less containers</li>
<li>Copa works with the existing vulnerability scanning and mitigation ecosystems.
<em>(Image publishers don't need to create new workflows for container patching since Copa supports patching container images using the security update packages already being published today.)</em>
<em>(Consumers do not need to migrate to a new and potentially more limited support ecosystem for custom distros or change their container vulnerability scanning pipelines to include remediation since Copa can be integrated seamlessly as an extra step to patch containers based on those scanning reports.)</em></li>
<li>Copa reduces the technical expertise needed and waiting on dependencies needed to patch an image.
<em>(For OS package vulnerabilities, no specialized knowledge about a specific image is needed to be patch it as Copa relies on the vulnerability remediation knowledge already embedded in the reports produced by popular container scanning tools today.)</em></li>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="azure-devops-deploy">🚀Azure DevOps deploy<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/automate-container-patching-with-trivy-copacetic-azure-devops/#azure-devops-deploy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🚀Azure DevOps deploy" title="Direct link to 🚀Azure DevOps deploy">​</a></h2>
<p>So let's get started by creating a new Azure DevOps pipeline that will use Trivy to scan a container image for vulnerabilities, and then use Copa to patch the vulnerabilities found by Trivy, and then push the patched image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR).</p>
<p>First we need to create the Service Connection, we can create a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/containers/publish-to-acr?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker Registry service connection</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Create Service Connection" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/docker-registry-acr-serviceconnection-899ff4e48ae4dbd6aed45af177283510.png" width="681" height="1021" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Then, we can use the pipeline to connect to the Container Registry and patch the Container.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Make sure you update the parameters, and Service Principal variable name with the up-to-date versions of Trivy, Copacetic and BuildKit, at the time you run this, and of course the container image you want to patch.</p>

<p>For demo purposes, I am using an older version of the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/api-firewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">api-firewall</a> image, which has known vulnerabilities that must be patched.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deployment-results">✅Deployment results<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/automate-container-patching-with-trivy-copacetic-azure-devops/#deployment-results" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ✅Deployment results" title="Direct link to ✅Deployment results">​</a></h3>
<p>Let's look at the image in Azure Container Registry before the patch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="API FW Before Patch" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/api-firewall-acr-beforecopapatch-f7b59d864bc68fe82c35a4dd0962e007.png" width="1603" height="574" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Now, let us deploy the pipeline and see the results.</p>

<p>After the pipeline has run, we can see the patched image in the Azure Container Registry.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="API Firewall" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/api-firewall-acr-aftercopapatch-7ed500a7d4a5bbc90c4794f10f0792de.png" width="1552" height="552" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>If we re-run the pipeline again, this time targetting our new patched image, we can see that there are no patchable vulnerabilities found.</p>

It is also recommended not to layer patch on top of patch, as this can lead to a bloated image, and potential conflicts between patches, consider patching the same base image other an an already patched image, if new updates occur.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Codespaces</a> already have Docker preinstalled as a dependency for the Codespaces environment. This article will guide you through pulling and pushing a Docker image from DockerHub to Azure Container Registry using GitHub Codespaces.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>Pushing a container from Docker Hub to your own Azure Container Registry (ACR) can offer several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security: You can control who can access your container images, and gives you more control over vulnerability scanning.</li>
<li>Network latency: You can reduce network latency by hosting your container images closer to your deployment targets.</li>
<li>Compliance: You can meet compliance requirements by storing your container images in a specific region.</li>
<li>Integration: You can integrate your container images with other Azure services.</li>
</ul>

<li>Install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker extension</a> for Visual Studio Code in the Codespace</li>

<li>Now we need to log to our Azure Registry; under Registry, select Azure, and connect and log in to your Azure account</li>
<li>Now, we don't have any images, so we need to pull them down from the docker hub. Open the terminal and run the following command:</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When attempting to deploy a Container Apps Environment integrated into a VNET <em>(Virtual Network)</em> that was pre-created, you may have issues selecting a subnet which your Container Apps Environment should be deployed into, as your subnet may not be appearing in the Azure Portal to select.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Container App Environment - Missing subnet" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/container-apps-env-subnetmissing-7fd2515443782c92d89e11f2eb18e7cb.png" width="1090" height="655" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Before we continue, make sure that the subnet address ranges match at least the following:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Workload Profile</th><th>Minimum Subnet Size for Virtual Network Integration</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Standard</td><td>/27</td></tr><tr><td>Consumption</td><td>/23</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>If you have a subnet that meets the requirements, you can proceed with trying the following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the Subnet you want to use to deploy your Container Apps environment into it.</li>
<li>Now we need to recreate the subnet using the Azure CLI <em>(you can use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure CloudShell</a>)</em> by running the following command <em>(replace the values with your own)</em>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">az network vnet subnet create --resource-group RG1  --vnet-name VNET1  </span><span class="token parameter variable" style="color:rgb(189, 147, 249);font-style:italic">--name</span><span class="token plain"> ACASubnet  --address-prefix </span><span class="token string" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">'10.0.4.0/23'</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>After running the command, you should now be able to select the subnet created in the Azure Portal.</p>

<p>If we look at the differences between a subnet created in the Azure Portal Container Apps Environment experience and one created using the Azure CLI, we can see that there are differences:</p>

<p>In the non-working example, the addressPrefixes property is used instead of addressPrefix.</p>
<p>The difference lies in how the address prefix is represented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working Example: Uses addressPrefix as a single-string property.</li>
<li>Non-working Example: Uses addressPrefixes as an array with one element</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[This article provides a step-by-step guide on setting up an Azure Application Gateway Sinkhole using Terraform.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you use an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure API Management</a> solution in Internal mode, you may also want to use an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Application Gateway</a> to provide additional security and performance features for external consumers as well and contain a mix of both Internal <em>(to your own vnet and private dns)</em> and <em>(external, accessed via public DNS)</em> APIs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="APIM Management Internal" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/apim_internal_appgw-2604fcaed23f9dd476aba5879a864bf1.png" width="978" height="559" class="img_ev3q">
<em>(Image courtesy of: <a href="https://medium.com/@thahif.86/azure-apim-and-application-gateway-integration-9039378ba197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure APIM and Application Gateway Integration</a>)</em></p>
<p>In this scenario, you can use the following paths on your APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal</strong>: <code>https://apim.yourdomain.com/internal/echo</code></li>
<li><strong>External</strong>: <code>https://apim.yourdomain.com/external/echo</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Where the path of Internal is only intended for internal consumers and internal APIs, and the external path is intended to be accessed externally <em>(and in some cases internally)</em>. You can drop all traffic that reaches the Azure Application Gateway with an /internal URL by routing it to a backend that doesn't exist.</p>
<p>To do this, you can create a Backend Pool named sinkhole and a Rule to route traffic to the sinkhole pool based on the path using the Application Gateway path routing rules.</p>

<p>This Terraform code is configuring an Azure Application Gateway, which is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what each section does:</p>
<ul>
<li>url_path_map: This block defines a URL path-based routing rule. It specifies how HTTP traffic is routed to different backend pools based on the URL paths of the HTTP requests.</li>
<li>default_backend_address_pool_name and default_backend_http_settings_name define the default backend pool and HTTP settings to use if none of the specified path rules match.</li>
<li>Two path_rule blocks are defined. Each path_rule specifies a condition (based on the URL path) and the corresponding backend pool and HTTP settings to use when the condition is met. The first rule routes requests with paths starting with "/external" to the "apim" backend pool. The second rule routes requests with paths starting with "/internal" to the "sinkhole" backend pool.
request_routing_rule: This block defines a request routing rule, determining how the Application Gateway distributes traffic to the backend pools.</li>
<li>rule_type is set to "PathBasedRouting," which means the rule is based on URL paths.</li>
<li>http_listener_name specifies the HTTP listener to associate with the rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>url_path_map_name specifies the URL path map to use, which is defined in the url_path_map block.</p>
<p>Priority sets the priority of the rule. Lower numbers have higher priority. If a request matches multiple rules, the rule with the highest priority is applied.</p>
<p>So let us look at the sinkhole configuration:</p>
<div class="language-hcl codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-hcl codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token keyword" style="color:rgb(189, 147, 249);font-style:italic">backend_address_pool</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token property">name</span><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">"sinkhole"</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token property">fqdns</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">=</span><span class="token plain"> null</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">}</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what each line does:</p>
<ul>
<li>backend_address_pool: This block defines a backend address pool, which is a collection of IP addresses to which the Application Gateway can route network traffic.</li>
<li>"sinkhole": This line sets the name of the backend address pool to "sinkhole." This name is used to reference the backend address pool in other parts of the configuration.</li>
<li>fqdns = null: This line sets the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) of the backend addresses to null. This means that the backend address pool does not contain any backend addresses. In the context of a "sinkhole" pool, this is likely intended to discard traffic or direct it to a non-existent endpoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps you understand how to configure a sinkhole pool in Azure Application Gateway using Terraform. This allows you to offer both external and internal APIs through the gateway. You can also have a private listener with a different routing rile if you want to offer all the internal and external APIs to your internal consumers/networks.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Detailed guide on setting up an Azure Proactive Resiliency Assessment.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://azure.github.io/Azure-Proactive-Resiliency-Library-v2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Proactive Resiliency Library</a> is a curated collection of best practices, guidance, and recommendations designed to improve the resiliency of applications and services running in Azure. Built on the Resiliency pillar of the Well-Architected Framework, this catalog provides valuable insights to ensure your workloads remain robust and reliable.</p>
<p>The library also includes automation capabilities (using Azure Graph queries) that allow you to collect data, analyze it, and generate detailed Word and PowerPoint reports. These reports, part of the Well-Architected Resiliency Assessment workshop, provide visibility into the resiliency of your Azure workloads. This toolset, often used by Microsoft Cloud Solution architects, can be leveraged to identify areas for improvement in your own Azure estate, following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/well-architected/reliability/principles?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resiliency</a> well-architected principles.</p>
<p>In this article, we will walk through the process of running the scripts to collect, analyze, and report on resiliency data for your workloads using the Azure Proactive Resiliency Library to help you identify and address potential reliability issues in your Azure environment.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-overview">🌐 Overview<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/proactive-resiliency-assessment/#-overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🌐 Overview" title="Direct link to 🌐 Overview">​</a></h2>
<p>Along with recommendations to increase Azure resource resiliency, supplementing the guidance on the Well-Architected Framework, the proactive resiliency library includes sample <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Resource Graph queries</a>, to determine the current state of your resources.</p>

<p>An improvement to this automation is the ability to run queries to collect, analyze, and create a Word and PowerPoint report for your Azure workloads; these reports are part of a Workshop delivery initiative - Well-Architected Reliability Assessment, usually driven by Microsoft Cloud Solution architects, we can leverage the same toolsets, to help increase visibility across the state of the reliability of our own Azure estate. This is not a set-and-forget tool but a starting point to help you understand the current state of your resources to help you make informed decisions on how to improve the reliability of your Azure workloads and an avenue to highlight Reliability improvements. This process works best when scoped to a specific workload vs an entire environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, why must we consider reliability and resiliency in our Azure workloads?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is simple: ensure that your applications and services are available and reliable, even when failures occur. This is important for business continuity and ensuring that your customers can access your services when needed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Azure Proactive Resiliency Library - Importance of realibility" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/AzProactiveResiliencyLibrary_ImportanceRealiability-84010f457c76af363dd7111889e21081.png" width="1511" height="844" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When managing resources and workloads in Azure, ensuring reliability is paramount to avoid unexpected failures and downtime. But why exactly do bad things happen, even when there seem to be numerous safeguards in place? Let's delve into reliability and why it's essential for your Azure environment by exploring the "Swiss Cheese Model" of accident causation, illustrated in the image above.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiss Cheese Model</a>, developed by James Reason, is a popular way to understand how errors and failures occur in complex systems. Each defense layer—represented as Swiss cheese slices—has holes or weaknesses. When these holes align across multiple layers, an accident can occur. Let's break down this model and see how it applies to Azure reliability.</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutional Level: Institutions may need more procedures and regulatory narrowness at the highest level. In the context of Azure, this could mean inadequate governance policies or a lack of compliance with best practices. These gaps can create vulnerabilities that might be exploited, leading to system failures.</li>
<li>Organizational Level: Organizations often face mixed messages and production pressures. This could translate to conflicting priorities for Azure between rapid deployment and maintaining robust security and reliability. Pressure to deliver quickly might lead to overlooked reliability checks, creating potential points of failure.</li>
<li>Professional Level: Issues such as responsibility shifting can arise at the professional level. In an Azure environment, this might occur when there is a lack of clear ownership over different architecture components, leading to neglected maintenance and updates.</li>
<li>Team Level: Teams might suffer from inadequate training. In Azure, this could mean insufficient knowledge about Azure services, leading to suboptimal configuration and resource management. Proper training ensures that teams can effectively manage and troubleshoot their environments.</li>
<li>Individual Level: Individual contributors might be distracted or make errors. In Azure, this could involve misconfigurations or overlooking critical logs and alerts. Encouraging a culture of attention to detail and thoroughness can help mitigate these risks.</li>
<li>Technical Level: Finally, technical issues such as clumsy technology, coding bugs, and deferred maintenance can directly impact reliability; in Azure, this might involve outdated software versions, unpatched vulnerabilities, or inefficient resource configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding the layers of defense and potential triggers for failures, you can take proactive steps to enhance the reliability of your Azure resources and workloads, ensuring a robust, secure, and efficient cloud environment.</p>
<p>The Azure Proactive Resiliency library and the assessments we will run through will concentrate on the technical level to ensure that your Azure resources are configured correctly and are resilient to failures; however, the other layers of defense are also essential to consider and are a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/reliability/overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#reliability-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared responsibility</a> between Microsoft and the customer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Azure Proactive Resiliency Library - shared responsibility" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/AzProactiveResiliencyLibrary_SharedResponsibility-f11723a008cf0c2993a7e12ee2c252ed.png" width="1500" height="826" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>So - let us get started with the Azure Proactive Resiliency Library and the assessment report.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-create-resiliency-reports">📊 Create Resiliency Reports<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/proactive-resiliency-assessment/#-create-resiliency-reports" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 📊 Create Resiliency Reports" title="Direct link to 📊 Create Resiliency Reports">​</a></h2>
<p>The Assessment report is a 3 stage process.</p>
<ol>
<li>collect the data</li>
<li>analyse the data</li>
<li>create the report</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Azure Proactive Resiliency Library - Assessment report" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/AzProactiveResiliencyLibrary_AssessmentProcess-72f9d8938d16ed43c8a53f7bd5f86977.png" width="993" height="588" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can do both the data collection in an Azure CloudShell, which is useful for running this in customer environments; however, to create and analyze the data, you must run the script from a computer with Word and Excel installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>It is worth noting that not all services will be supported by the automated resource graph queries, so you will need to check any services that are not supported manually, and when looking at running this for Production workloads, remember to consider the business context around the resiliency requirements.</strong></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-collect-the-data">📊 Collect the data<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/proactive-resiliency-assessment/#-collect-the-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 📊 Collect the data" title="Direct link to 📊 Collect the data">​</a></h3>

<p>The Report Generator PowerShell script is the final script in the Azure Proactive Resiliency Library (APRL) tooling suite. Its goal is to generate a Word and PowerPoint report based on the data collected and analyzed by the Collector and Data Analyzer scripts.</p>
<p>Now that we have our main Excel Action plan with the data, we can run the Report Generator script to create the Word and PowerPoint reports.</p>
<p>The previous script, would have downloaded the git repository for the Azure Proactive Library to your local device, so you can run the Report Generator script directly from that, the script needs to be ran.</p>
<p>This script requires specific Microsoft PowerPoint and Word templates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mandatory - Executive Summary presentation - Template.pptx</li>
<li>Optional - Assessment Report - Template.docx</li>
</ul>
<p>These are stored in the Tools folder of the Azure Proactive Library repository.</p>
<p>The 3_wara_report_generator.ps1 script has the following parameters:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th><th>Example Demo Parameters</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ExcelFile</td><td>Mandatory: WARA Excel file generated by ‘2_wara_data_analyzer.ps1’ script and customized.</td><td>C:\path\to\WARA_Analysis.xlsx</td></tr><tr><td>CustomerName</td><td>Optional: specifies the Name of the Customer to be added to the PPTx and DOCx files.</td><td>Contoso Ltd</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy</td><td>Optional: Run the script at a lower pace to handle heavy environments.</td><td>TRUE</td></tr><tr><td>WorkloadName</td><td>Optional: specifies the Name of the Workload of the analyses to be added to the PPTx and DOCx files.</td><td>E-commerce Platform</td></tr><tr><td>PPTTemplateFile</td><td>Optional: specifies the PPTx template file for use as source. If not specified, the script will look for the file in the same path as the script.</td><td>C:\path\to\Template.pptx</td></tr><tr><td>WordTemplateFile</td><td>Optional: specifies the DOCx template file for use as source. If not specified, the script will look for the file in the same path as the script.</td><td>C:\path\to\Template.docx</td></tr><tr><td>Debugging</td><td>Optional: Writes a piece of Debugging information to a log file.</td><td>TRUE</td></tr></tbody></table>
<ol>
<li>Open a PowerShell 7 terminal</li>
<li>Run the following script <em>(adjust for your needs, it will look in the same folder that the script is located in for the word and excel templates)</em>:</li>

<p>Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are templates that can be applied to solve a problem in a specific context. They are not finished designs that can be transformed directly into code. They are a starting point for your design.</p>

They have been around for a long time. The concept of design patterns was introduced by the architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander#:~:text=Alexander%25%20and%20personally%20built,architect%20and%20a%20general%20contractor.&amp;text=In%20software%2C%20Alexander%20is%20regarded,to%20its%20creator%2C%20Ward%20Cunningham" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher Alexander</a> in the field of architecture and later adopted by software engineers.</p></div></div>
<p>Design patterns are essential to consider when implementing your solutions as they help with the following:</p>
<p>Reusability - Design patterns promote reusability by providing proven solutions to common problems, allowing components and subsystems to be used in other applications and scenarios and interoperability</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintainability - They simplify administration and development, making maintaining and updating applications easier.</li>
<li>Consistency - Design patterns ensure consistency and coherence in component design and deployment, which is crucial for the overall quality of the application</li>
<li>Efficiency - By following established patterns, developers can avoid repetitive work and focus on implementing specific requirements, thus saving development time</li>
<li>Scalability - Design patterns help in designing scalable systems by providing guidelines for efficient resource allocation and management</li>
<li>Performance - They help optimize the use of system resources, leading to improved performance of the application&nbsp;</li>
<li>Modularity - Design patterns promote modular and structured code, making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is as true in Modern Cloud solutions as it is in traditional development, with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/well-architected/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well-architected principles</a> more important than ever.</p>
<p>Take a Cloud Platform or ecosystem like Azure, with Services offering a theory of functionality that can be put together like Lego bricks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalability—Cloud design patterns address scalability by providing solutions for horizontal and vertical scaling, ensuring that applications can handle increased loads efficiently. This promotes sustainability by enabling dynamic resource allocation and reducing energy consumption during low-demand periods.</li>
<li>Resilience—Patterns like Circuit Breakers and Bulkhead help build resilient applications that can withstand failures and continue to function. Sustainable operations are achieved by minimizing downtime and resource wastage, thus ensuring efficient resource use.</li>
<li>Security—Security patterns such as API Gateway and Secure Token ensure that applications are protected against malicious actors while maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Secure systems support sustainability by preventing security breaches that could lead to resource wastage.</li>
<li>Operational Excellence - Patterns like Ambassador and Anti-Corruption Layer enhance operational excellence by simplifying the management and monitoring of cloud applications. Efficient management practices contribute to sustainability by optimizing resource usage and reducing unnecessary overhead.</li>
<li>Performance Efficiency - Patterns such as Cache-Aside and Compute Resource Consolidation optimize performance by efficiently managing resources and reducing latency. Effective resource management leads to sustainability by lowering the overall resource footprint and energy consumption.</li>
<li>Data Management—Data management patterns address data consistency, synchronization, and management challenges across different locations, which is crucial for cloud applications. Sustainable data practices ensure data is stored and processed efficiently, minimizing energy use and reducing environmental impact.</li>

<p>When talking about design patterns, we will be using a few acronyms, and it is important to understand what they mean in order to fully understand the context.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Acronym</th><th>Definition</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Service</td><td>A service in cloud pattern design refers to a distinct function or set of functions a cloud application provides. Services are typically designed to be reusable and can be consumed by multiple clients or consumers.</td><td>In a microservices architecture, each microservice is a service that performs a specific business function, such as user authentication, payment processing, or data storage.</td></tr><tr><td>Consumer</td><td>A &nbsp;consumer is an entity (such as an application, service, or user) that consumes or uses the services provided by another service. Consumers send requests to services and receive responses.</td><td>A web application that calls an authentication service to verify user credentials is a consumer of that authentication service.</td></tr><tr><td>Tenant</td><td>In a multi-tenant architecture, a tenant is a group of users who share common access with specific privileges to the software instance. Each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.</td><td>In a Software as a Service (SaaS) application, each customer (company or organization) is considered a tenant. They have their own isolated data and configuration settings within the shared application.</td></tr><tr><td>Facade</td><td>The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use and understand. It acts as a high-level interface that hides the complexities of the underlying system.</td><td>In a software application, a facade can be used to provide a simplified API that abstracts away the complexities of interacting with multiple subsystems or modules.</td></tr><tr><td>Asynchronous</td><td>Asynchronous communication is a messaging pattern where the sender and receiver do not need to interact in real time. The sender can send a message and continue with other tasks, while the receiver processes the message at its own pace.</td><td>In a distributed system, asynchronous messaging can be used to decouple components and improve scalability. For example, a message queue can be used to send and receive messages between different services.</td></tr><tr><td>Synchronous</td><td>Synchronous communication is a messaging pattern where the sender and receiver interact in real time. The sender sends a message and waits for a response from the receiver before proceeding.</td><td>In a request-response scenario, a client sends a request to a server and waits for the server to process the request and send back a response. This pattern is commonly used in HTTP-based APIs.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Cloud design patterns can be categorized into different Archetypes <em>(categories)</em> based on their characteristics and use cases. These archetypes provide a structured way to understand and apply patterns in cloud architecture design.</p>
<p>The categories include Data Management, Security, Reliability, Messaging, and Design and implementation. Let's examine each category in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Management patterns help us manage data in the cloud. Caching helps us reduce the number of database hits and improve application performance. Sharding helps us partition our data across multiple databases to improve scalability. Federation helps us distribute data across multiple databases for better availability and fault tolerance.</li>
<li>Security patterns help us secure our applications in the cloud. Perimeter Networks help us isolate our applications from the Internet. Identity Management helps us manage user identities and access to resources. Secure Communication helps us protect our data in transit.</li>
<li>Reliability patterns help us build highly available and fault-tolerant applications in the cloud. Retry helps us recover from transient failures. Circuit Breakers help us prevent cascading failure. Bulkhead helps us limit the damage caused by a failure.</li>
<li>Messaging patterns help us build scalable and decoupled applications in the cloud. Asynchronous Messaging helps us send messages between components in a non-blocking way. Event Sourcing helps us capture all changes to an application state. Competing Consumers help us process messages in parallel.</li>
<li>Design and implementation patterns help us build scalable and resilient cloud-native applications. Valet Key helps us delegate access to resources. Ambassador helps us expose services to external clients. Gateway helps us provide a single entry point to our application.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Load data on demand into a cache from a data store</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many commercial caching systems provide read-through and write-through/write-behind operations. In these systems, an application retrieves data by referencing the cache.</p>
<p>If the data isn't in the cache, it's retrieved from the data store and added to the cache. Any modifications to data held in the cache are also automatically written back to the data store.</p>
<p>For caches that don't provide this functionality, it's the responsibility of the applications that use the cache to maintain the data.</p>
<p>If an application updates information, it can follow the write-through strategy by modifying the data store and invalidating the corresponding item in the cache. When the item is next required, using the cache-aside strategy will cause the updated data to be retrieved from the data store and added back into the cache.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Cloud Design Pattern - CacheAsSide" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_CacheAside-c416d22a006cae6f244c9bdc927de735.gif" width="1903" height="1005" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifetime of cached data. Many caches implement an expiration policy that invalidates data and removes it from the cache if it's not accessed for a specified period. For cache-aside to be effective, ensure that the expiration policy matches the pattern of access for applications that use the data. Don't make the expiration period too short because this can cause applications to continually retrieve data from the data store and add it to the cache. Similarly, don't make the expiration period so long that the cached data will likely become stale. Remember that caching is most effective for relatively static data or data that is read frequently.</li>
<li>Evicting data. Most caches have a limited size compared to the data store where the data originates, and they'll evict data if necessary. Most caches adopt a least-recently-used policy for selecting items to evict, but this might be customizable. Configure the global expiration property and other properties of the cache, as well as the expiration property of each cached item, to ensure that the cache is cost-effective. Applying a global eviction policy to every item in the cache isn't always appropriate. For example, if a cached item is costly to retrieve from the data store, it can be beneficial to keep this item in the cache at the expense of more frequently accessed but less costly items.</li>
<li>Priming the cache. Many solutions prepopulate the cache with the data that an application is likely to need during startup processing. The Cache-Aside pattern can still be useful if some of this data expires or is evicted.</li>
<li>Consistency. Implementing the Cache-Aside pattern doesn't guarantee consistency between the data store and the cache. An external process can change an item in the data store at any time, and this change might not be reflected in the cache until the next time the item is loaded. In a system replicating data across data stores, this problem can become serious if synchronization occurs frequently.</li>
<li>Local <em>(in-memory)</em> caching. A cache could be local to an application instance and stored in memory. Cache-aside can be useful in this environment if an application repeatedly accesses the same data. However, a local cache is private, so different application instances could each have a copy of the same cached data. This data could quickly become inconsistent between caches, so it might be necessary to expire data in a private cache and refresh it more frequently. In these scenarios, investigate a shared or distributed caching mechanism.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>When an in-built cache doesn't provide native read-through or write-back operations.</li>
<li>When resource demand is unpredictable, you want to avoid overloading the data store.</li>

<p>In this example, it uses <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Cache for Redis</a>. When an application needs to retrieve data, it will first check to see if it exists in Azure Cache for Redis.
If the data is found in Azure Cache for Redis (cache hit), the application will use this data.
If the data is not found in Azure Cache for Redis (cache miss), the application must retrieve it from the appropriate Azure database service.
For cache miss scenarios, the requesting application should add the data retrieved from the Azure Database service to Azure Cache for Redis.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-sharding">📚 Sharding<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/cloud-design-patterns/#-sharding" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 📚 Sharding" title="Direct link to 📚 Sharding">​</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Divide a data store into a set of horizontal partitions or shards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dividing a data store into a set of horizontal partitions or shards. This can improve scalability when storing and accessing large volumes of data.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Lookup strategy. In this strategy, the sharding logic implements a map that routes a request for data to the shard containing that data using the shard key. In a multi-tenant application, all the data for a tenant might be stored together in a shard using the tenant ID as the shard key. Multiple tenants might share the same shard, but the data for a single tenant won't be spread across multiple shards.</li>
<li>The Range strategy. This strategy groups related items together in the same shard and orders them by shard key—the shard keys are sequential. It's useful for applications that frequently retrieve sets of items using range queries (queries that return a set of data items for a shard key that falls within a given range). For example, if an application regularly needs to find all orders placed in a given month, this data can be retrieved more quickly if all orders for a month are stored in date and time order in the same shard. If each order were stored in a different shard, they'd have to be fetched individually by performing many point queries (queries that return a single data item).&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Hash strategy. The purpose of this strategy is to reduce the chance of hotspots (shards that receive a disproportionate amount of load). It distributes the data across the shards in a way that achieves a balance between the size of each shard and the average load that each shard will encounter. The sharding logic computes the shard to store an item in based on a hash of one or more data attributes. The chosen hashing function should distribute data evenly across the shards, possibly by introducing some random element into the computation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the following points when deciding how to implement this pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balancing data across multiple shards.</li>
<li>Your queries need to be efficient and not require data from multiple shards or cause latency issues.</li>
<li>Designing for scalability (storage nodes – data &amp; throughput)</li>
<li>Designing for availability (replication, failover, recovery)</li>
<li>Make sure to use stable and unique key data to determine the sharding state</li>
<li>Monitoring, backup, and maintaining consistency of multiple shards can be difficult.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-to-use-this-pattern-1">When to use this pattern<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/cloud-design-patterns/#when-to-use-this-pattern-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When to use this pattern" title="Direct link to When to use this pattern">​</a></h4>
<p>The primary focus of sharding is to improve the performance and scalability of a system. Still, as a by-product it can also improve availability due to how the data is divided into separate partitions. A failure in one partition doesn't necessarily prevent an application from accessing data held in other partitions, and an operator can perform maintenance or recovery of one or more partitions without making the entire data for an application inaccessible.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When the data store is likely to need to scale beyond the resources of a single storage node.</li>
<li>When you can improve performance  by reducing contention on a single data store.</li>
<li>When you need to optimize cost by multiple instances of less expensive compute or storage.</li>
<li>Improve resilience and reliability.</li>
<li>When you have geographical concerns, i.e., Optimization based on where users or systems are located.</li>

<p>Consider a website that surfaces an expansive collection of information on published books worldwide.
The number of possible books cataloged in this workload and the typical query/usage patterns contra-indicate the usage of a single relational database to store the book information. The workload architect decides to shard the data across multiple database instances, using the books' static International Standard Book Number (ISBN) for the shard key. Specifically, they use the&nbsp;check digit&nbsp;(0 - 10) of the ISBN as that gives 11 possible logical shards, and the data will be balanced across each shard. First, they decide to colocate the 11 logical shards into three physical shard databases. They use the&nbsp;lookup&nbsp;sharding approach and store the key-to-server mapping information in a shard map database.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Use a token or key that provides clients with restricted direct access to a specific resource or service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data stores have the ability to handle the upload and download of data directly without requiring the application to perform any processing to move this data. However, this typically requires the client to have access to the store's security credentials. This can be a useful technique to minimize data transfer costs and the requirement to scale out the application and to maximize performance. It means, though, that the application is no longer able to manage the security of the data. After the client has a connection to the data store for direct access, the application can't act as the gatekeeper. It's no longer in control of the process and can't prevent subsequent uploads or downloads from the data store.
This isn't a realistic approach in distributed systems that need to serve untrusted clients.</p>
<p>Applications must be able to securely control access to data in a granular way, but still reduce the load on the server by setting up this connection and then allowing the client to communicate directly with the data store to perform the required read or write operations.</p>

<ul>
<li>Offload data transfer from the application to minimize the use of valuable resources such as computing, memory, and bandwidth.</li>
<li>When the data is stored in a remote data store or a different datacenter from the application.</li>
<li>Minimize operational costs by enabling direct access to stores and queues.</li>
<li>Clients regularly upload or download data, particularly where there's a large volume or when each operation involves a large file</li>

<p>Azure supports shared access signatures on Azure Storage for granular access control to data in blobs, tables, and queues, and for Service Bus queues and topics. A shared access signature token can be configured to provide specific access rights such as read, write, update, and delete to a specific table, a key range within a table, a queue, a blob, or a blob container. The validity can be a specified time period. This functionality is well-suited for accessing a valet key.</p>

<p>Create helper services that send network requests on behalf of a consumer service or application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Resilient cloud-based applications require features such as&nbsp;circuit breaking, routing, metering and monitoring, and the ability to make network-related configuration updates. It may be difficult or impossible to update legacy applications or existing code libraries to add these features because the code is no longer maintained or can't be easily modified by the development team.
Network calls may also require substantial configuration for connection, authentication, and authorization. If these calls are used across multiple applications, built using multiple languages and frameworks, the calls must be configured for each of these instances. In addition, network and security functionality may need to be managed by a central team within your organization. With a large code base, it can be risky for that team to update application code they aren't familiar with.</p>
<p>Put client frameworks and libraries into an external process that acts as a proxy between your application and external services. Deploy the proxy on the same host environment as your application to allow control over routing, resiliency, and security features and to avoid any host-related access restrictions.</p>

<p>When implementing the Ambassador pattern, consider the following issues and considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Latency Overhead- The proxy adds some latency overhead. It is important to evaluate whether a client library, invoked directly by the application, might be a better approach to avoid this additional latency</li>
<li>Generalized Features - Including generalized features in the proxy can have unintended consequences. For example, the ambassador could handle retries, but this might not be safe unless all operations are idempotent. Ensure that the features implemented in the proxy do not introduce risks or conflicts with the application's requirements</li>
<li>Context Passing — Consider a mechanism that allows the client to pass some context to the proxy and back to the client. For example, include HTTP request headers to opt out of retry or specify the maximum number of times to retry. This flexibility can help tailor the proxy's behavior to specific needs.</li>
<li>Packaging and Deployment - Think about how to package and deploy the proxy. The proxy can be deployed as a sidecar to accompany the lifecycle of a consuming application or service. Alternatively, if an ambassador is shared by multiple separate processes on a common host, it can be deployed as a daemon or Windows service</li>
<li>Shared vs. Dedicated Instances - Decide whether to use a single shared instance for all clients or an instance for each client. This decision can impact resource utilization, performance, and isolation between different clients</li>
<li>Security and Configuration - Network calls may require substantial connection, authentication, and authorization configuration. If these calls are used across multiple applications built using multiple languages and frameworks, the calls must be configured for each of these instances. Additionally, network and security functionality may need to be managed by a central team within your organization</li>
<li>Specialized Teams - Features that are offloaded to the ambassador can be managed independently of the application. This allows for separate, specialized teams to implement and maintain security, networking, or authentication features that have been moved to the ambassador without disturbing the application's legacy functionalityBy addressing these issues and considerations, you can effectively implement the Ambassador pattern to enhance the networking capabilities, security, and maintainability of your applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Ambassador pattern should be used in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offloading Common Client Connectivity Tasks - When you need to offload common client connectivity tasks such as monitoring, logging, routing, security (such as TLS), and resiliency patterns in a language-agnostic way</li>
<li>Legacy Applications - When dealing with legacy applications or other applications that are difficult to modify, the Ambassador pattern can extend their networking capabilities without requiring changes to the application code</li>
<li>Specialized Teams - When you want to enable a specialized team to implement and maintain security, networking, or authentication features independently of the application. This allows for updates and modifications to the ambassador without disturbing the application's legacy functionality</li>
<li>Resilient Cloud-Based Applications - When building resilient cloud-based applications that require features such as circuit breaking, routing, metering and monitoring, and the ability to make network-related configuration updates. The Ambassador pattern can facilitate these features without modifying the existing codebase</li>
<li>Centralized Management of Network and Security - When network calls require substantial configuration for connection, authentication, and authorization across multiple applications built using multiple languages and frameworks. The Ambassador pattern allows these configurations to be managed centrally, reducing the risk of updating application code by a team unfamiliar with it</li>
<li>Standardizing and Extending Instrumentation - When you need to standardize and extend instrumentation, such as monitoring performance metrics like latency or resource usage. The Ambassador pattern allows this monitoring to happen in the same host environment as the application</li>
<li>Supporting Cloud or Cluster Connectivity Requirements - When you need to support cloud or cluster connectivity requirements in a legacy application or an application that is difficult to modify considering these scenarios, you can effectively use the Ambassador pattern to enhance the networking capabilities, security, and maintainability of your applications.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Deploy application components into a separate process or container to provide isolation and encapsulation. This pattern can also enable applications composed of heterogeneous components and technologies.
This pattern is named&nbsp;Sidecar&nbsp;because it resembles a sidecar attached to a motorcycle. In the pattern, the sidecar is attached to a parent application and provides supporting features for the application. The sidecar also shares the same lifecycle as the parent application, being created and retired alongside the parent. The sidecar pattern is sometimes referred to as the sidekick pattern and is a decomposition pattern.</p>

<p>When implementing the Sidecar pattern, consider the following issues and considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployment and Packaging - Carefully decide on the deployment and packaging format for services, processes, or containers. Containers are particularly well-suited to the sidecar pattern</li>
<li>Interprocess Communication - Choose the interprocess communication mechanism wisely. Aim to use language- or framework-agnostic technologies unless performance requirements make that impractical</li>
<li>Functionality Placement - Before placing functionality into a sidecar, consider whether it would work better as a separate service or a more traditional daemon. Also, evaluate if the functionality could be implemented as a library or using a traditional extension mechanism, as language-specific libraries may offer deeper integration and less network overhead</li>
<li>Resource Management - The sidecar can access the same resources as the primary application, which allows it to monitor system resources used by both the sidecar and the primary application</li>
<li>Latency - Communication between a parent application and sidecar services includes some overhead, notably call latency. This may not be an acceptable trade-off for chatty interfaces</li>
<li>Application Size and Resource Cost - For small applications, the resource cost of deploying a sidecar service for each instance may not be worth the advantage of isolation</li>
<li>Scaling - If the service needs to scale differently or independently from the main applications, it may be better to deploy the feature as a separate service</li>
<li>Security - By encapsulating tasks and deploying them out-of-process, you can reduce the surface area of sensitive processes to only the code needed to accomplish the task. Sidecars can also add cross-cutting security controls to an application component that is not natively designed with that functionality</li>
<li>Operational Excellence - The sidecar pattern provides an approach to implementing flexibility in tool integration that might enhance the application's observability without requiring the application to take direct implementation dependencies. It enables the sidecar functionality to evolve and be maintained independently of the application's lifecycle</li>
<li>Performance Efficiency - Moving cross-cutting tasks to a single process that can scale across multiple instances of the main process reduces the need to deploy duplicate functionality for each instance of the application, by addressing these issues and considerations, you can effectively implement the Sidecar pattern to enhance the modularity, security, and maintainability of your applications.</li>

<p>The Sidecar pattern should be used in the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heterogeneous Set of Languages and Frameworks - When your primary application uses a heterogeneous set of languages and frameworks. A component located in a sidecar service can be consumed by applications written in different languages using different frameworks</li>
<li>Component Ownership by Remote Teams - When a component is owned by a remote team or a different organization. This allows the component to be developed and maintained independently of the main application</li>
<li>Co-location Requirement - When a component or feature must be co-located on the same host as the application. This ensures that the component can access the same resources and environment as the primary application</li>
<li>Independent Updates - When you need a service that shares the overall lifecycle of your main application but can be independently updated. This allows for flexibility in updating the sidecar without affecting the main application</li>
<li>Fine-grained resource Control - When you need fine-grained control over resource limits for a particular resource or component. For example, you may want to restrict the amount of memory a specific component uses. Deploying the component as a sidecar allows you to manage memory usage independently of the main application</li>
<li>Security Enhancements - When you need to encapsulate tasks and deploy them out-of-process to reduce the surface area of sensitive processes to only the code needed to accomplish the task. Sidecars can also add cross-cutting security controls to an application component that is not natively designed with that functionality</li>
<li>Operational Excellence - When you want to implement flexibility in tool integration that might enhance the application's observability without requiring the application to take direct implementation dependencies. The sidecar functionality can evolve and be maintained independently of the application's lifecycle</li>

<p>Use a&nbsp;sidecar&nbsp;container that enhances the application with the required SSL functionality without modifying the application code. The sidecar pattern is a powerful concept in container-based architectures that lets you decompose application functionality into different container images that run together in the same container group.
In an Azure Container Instances container group, each container can take over part of the functionality the application requires. Sidecar containers can use different container images from the application container, even from different image repositories. Containers in the same container group share some properties, such as the underlying network stack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coordinate the actions performed by a collection of collaborating task instances in a distributed application by electing one instance as the leader who assumes responsibility for managing the other instances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A typical cloud application has many tasks acting in a coordinated manner. These tasks could all be instances running the same code and requiring access to the same resources, or they might be working together in parallel to perform the individual parts of a complex calculation.
The task instances might run separately for much of the time, but it might also be necessary to coordinate the actions of each instance to ensure that they don't conflict, cause contention for shared resources, or accidentally interfere with the work that other task instances are performing.
For example:
In a cloud-based system that implements horizontal scaling, multiple instances of the same task could be running at the same time with each instance serving a different user. If these instances write to a shared resource, it's necessary to coordinate their actions to prevent each instance from overwriting the changes made by the others.
If the tasks are performing individual elements of a complex calculation in parallel, the results need to be aggregated when they are all complete.</p>

<p>When implementing the Leader Election pattern, consider the following issues and considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventing Multiple Leaders - Ensure the election process is managed carefully to prevent two or more instances from taking over the leader position simultaneously. This requires a robust mechanism for selecting a leader that can handle events such as network outages or process failures</li>
<li>Failure Detection - The system must be able to detect when the leader has failed or become unavailable (e.g., due to a communications failure). The speed of detection depends on the system's requirements. Some systems can tolerate a short period without a leader, while others need immediate detection and a new election</li>
<li>Handling Leader Termination - In systems with horizontal autoscaling, the leader could be terminated if the system scales back and shuts down some computing resources. Ensure the system can handle such scenarios and elect a new leader promptly</li>
<li>Avoiding Single Points of Failure - Using a shared, distributed mutex introduces a dependency on the external service that provides the mutex, which can become a single point of failure. If this service becomes unavailable, the system won't be able to elect a leader</li>
<li>Leader as a Bottleneck - Avoid making the leader a bottleneck in the system. The leader's role is to coordinate the work of subordinate tasks, not necessarily to participate in the work itself. Ensure the leader can delegate tasks effectively to avoid performance issues</li>
<li>Latency and Performance - The resulting latency from leader coordination can affect the performance and response times of other processes if they are waiting for the leader to coordinate an operation. Optimize the leader election process to minimize latency</li>
<li>Flexibility and Optimization - Implementing leader election algorithms manually provides the greatest flexibility for tuning and optimizing the code. However, this approach requires careful design and testing to ensure robustness</li>
<li>Election Algorithms - Consider using established leader election algorithms such as the Bully Algorithm or the Ring Algorithm. These algorithms assume each candidate in the election has a unique ID and can communicate reliably with other candidates</li>
<li>Coordination Requirements - Use the Leader Election pattern when tasks in a distributed application need careful coordination and there is no natural leader. This pattern is useful for cloud-hosted solutions where multiple instances need to work together without conflict</li>
<li>Alternative Solutions — Evaluate whether a more lightweight method, such as optimistic or pessimistic locking, can achieve the required coordination. Also, consider third-party solutions like Apache Zookeeper for managing leader election and coordination tasks. By addressing these issues and considerations, you can effectively implement the Leader Election pattern to ensure reliable and efficient coordination in distributed systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Leader Election pattern should be used in the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Task Coordination - When you need to coordinate a task among multiple instances of a service or application. The Leader Election pattern ensures that one instance acts as the coordinator, preventing conflicts and ensuring smooth operation</li>
<li>Avoiding Single Points of Failure - When you want to avoid having a single point of failure in your application. By using leader election, if the current leader fails, a new leader is automatically selected, ensuring continuous operation without manual intervention&nbsp;</li>
<li>Distributed Systems - In distributed systems where multiple instances need to work together without conflict. The Leader Election pattern helps in managing coordination tasks effectively across different instances</li>
<li>High Availability Requirements - When your application requires high availability and resilience. The pattern helps in maintaining service continuity by electing a new leader if the current one fails, thus supporting failover mechanisms</li>
<li>Scalability - When you need to scale out your application horizontally. The Leader Election pattern can help manage the coordination of tasks across multiple instances, ensuring that the system scales efficiently without bottlenecks</li>
<li>Consensus Algorithms - When implementing consensus algorithms to manage failover and ensure that work is reliably redirected in case of node malfunctions. This is particularly useful in scenarios where reliability and self-healing are critical</li>
<li>Using Off-the-Shelf Solutions - When you prefer not to implement a leader election algorithm from scratch. Off-the-shelf solutions like Apache Zookeeper can be used to manage leader election and coordination tasks effectively. By considering these scenarios, you can effectively use the Leader Election pattern to ensure reliable and efficient coordination in distributed systems, enhancing the overall resilience and scalability of your application.</li>

<p>Incrementally migrate a legacy system by gradually replacing specific pieces of functionality with new applications and services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As systems age, the development tools, hosting technology, and even system architectures they were built on can become increasingly obsolete. As new features and functionality are added, the complexity of these applications can increase dramatically, making them harder to maintain or add new features to.
Completely replacing a complex system can be a huge undertaking. Often, you will need a gradual migration to a new system, while keeping the old system to handle features that haven't been migrated yet. However, running two separate versions of an application means that clients have to know where particular features are located. Every time a feature or service is migrated, clients need to be updated to point to the new location.</p>
<p>The Strangler Fig pattern involves gradually replacing parts of the legacy system with new services. This allows for a controlled and step-by-step transition rather than a wholesale move.</p>

<p>When implementing the Strangler Fig pattern, consider the following issues and considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Handling Services and Data Stores - Ensure that both new and legacy systems can access shared services and data stores. This is crucial for maintaining consistency and avoiding data integrity issues during the migration process&nbsp;</li>
<li>Structuring New Applications - Structure new applications and services in a way that they can easily be intercepted and replaced in future migrations. This helps in maintaining flexibility and ease of further transitions.</li>
<li>Facade Management - The facade, which intercepts requests and routes them to either the legacy or new system, must keep up with the migration. It should not become a single point of failure or a performance bottleneck. Proper management and monitoring of the facade are essential to ensure smooth operation2&nbsp;</li>
<li>Incremental Migration - The pattern supports incremental migration, which helps to minimize risk and spread the development effort over time. However, this requires careful planning to ensure that each increment is functional and does not disrupt the overall system</li>
<li>Client Updates - Running two separate versions of an application means that clients need to be updated to know where particular features are located. This can add complexity to the migration process, as each client must be aware of the changes and adapt accordingly</li>
<li>Avoiding Single Points of Failure - Ensure that the facade does not become a single point of failure. It should be designed to handle high availability and failover scenarios to maintain system reliability during the migration</li>
<li>Performance Considerations - The facade should not become a performance bottleneck. It must be capable of handling the load and routing requests efficiently to avoid degrading the user experience</li>
<li>Completing the Migration - At some point, when the migration is complete, the strangler fig facade will either go away or evolve into an adaptor for legacy clients. Plan for this transition to ensure that the final system is clean and does not retain unnecessary components2&nbsp;By addressing these issues and considerations, you can effectively implement the Strangler Fig pattern to ensure a smooth and controlled migration from a legacy system to a new architecture.</li>

<p>The Strangler Fig pattern should be used in the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gradual Migration -  When you need to incrementally migrate a legacy system to a new architecture. This pattern allows you to gradually replace specific pieces of functionality with new applications and services, minimizing risk and spreading the development effort over time</li>
<li>Complex Systems - When dealing with complex systems where a complete replacement would be a huge undertaking. The Strangler Fig pattern enables a controlled decomposition of a monolith into a set of microservices, allowing the legacy system to continue functioning while new features are added to the new system</li>
<li>Maintaining Functionality - When it is essential to keep the legacy system operational during the migration. The facade in the Strangler Fig pattern intercepts requests and routes them to either the legacy application or the new services, ensuring that consumers can continue using the same interface without being aware of the migration</li>
<li>Avoiding Big Bang Rewrites - When you want to avoid the risks associated with a "big bang" rewrite. The Strangler Fig pattern supports an incremental approach, allowing you to add functionality to the new system at your own pace while ensuring the legacy application continues to function</li>
<li>Modernizing Legacy Systems - When modernizing legacy systems that have become increasingly obsolete due to outdated development tools, hosting technology, or system architectures. The pattern helps in gradually transitioning to a new system while maintaining the old system for features that haven't been migrated yet</li>
<li>Using Modern Orchestration Tools - When you want to leverage modern orchestration tools such as Azure DevOps to manage the lifecycle of each service. Once the application has been decomposed into constituent microservices, these tools can be used to manage the new system effectively. Considering these scenarios, you can effectively use the Strangler Fig pattern to ensure a smooth and controlled migration from a legacy system to a new architecture, enhancing the overall resilience and scalability of your application.</li>

<p>The Sequential Convoy pattern is designed to process a set of related messages in a defined order without blocking the processing of other groups of messages. Here are some issues and considerations associated with this pattern</p>
<ul>
<li>Message Ordering - Ensuring that messages are processed in the order they arrive can be challenging in a distributed architecture. Workers can scale independently and often pull messages independently, which can disrupt the order of processing</li>
<li>Scalability - While the pattern allows for scaling out to handle increased load, it requires careful management to ensure that the order of messages is maintained. This can involve categorizing related messages within the queuing system and having queue listeners lock and pull only from one category at a time</li>
<li>Complexity in Implementation - Implementing the Sequential Convoy pattern can be complex, especially when dealing with interleaved transactions for multiple orders. The system must be designed to handle these transactions in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner at the order level</li>
<li>Resource Management - Efficiently managing resources to ensure that the processing of one group of messages does not block others is crucial. This involves coordinating actions across distributed services and remote resources</li>
<li>Error Handling - Handling errors in a sequential processing system can be more complex. If an error occurs, the system must ensure that subsequent messages are not processed until the error is resolved, which can involve implementing compensating transactions or other error recovery mechanisms By addressing these issues and considerations, the Sequential Convoy pattern can be effectively implemented to ensure ordered processing of related messages in a distributed system.</li>

<p>The Sequential Convoy pattern should be used in the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordered Message Processing - When you have messages that arrive in a specific order and must be processed in that same order. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of the operations being performed</li>
<li>Categorized Messages - When arriving messages can be categorized in such a way that the category becomes a unit of scale for the system. For example, in an order tracking system, messages can be categorized by order ID, ensuring that all operations related to a specific order are processed sequentially</li>
<li>Avoiding Blocking - When you need to process a set of related messages in a defined order without blocking the processing of other groups of messages. This allows for efficient handling of multiple message groups concurrently while maintaining order within each group&nbsp;However, this pattern might not be suitable for extremely high throughput scenarios (millions of messages per minute or second), as the FIFO (First in and First Out) requirement limits the scaling that can be done by the system.</li>

<p>Use a buffer between a task and a service that it invokes in order to smooth intermittent heavy loads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use a queue that acts as a buffer between a task and a service it invokes to smooth intermittent heavy loads that can cause the service to fail or the task to time out. This can help minimize the impact of peaks in demand on availability and responsiveness for both the task and the service.
Context and problem, many solutions in the cloud involve running tasks that invoke services. In this environment, if a service is subjected to intermittent heavy loads, it can cause performance or reliability issues.
A service could be part of the same solution as the tasks that use it, or it could be a third-party service providing access to frequently used resources such as a cache or a storage service. If the same service is used by a number of tasks running concurrently, it can be difficult to predict the volume of requests to the service at any time.
A service might experience peaks in demand that cause it to overload and be unable to respond to requests in a timely manner. Flooding a service with a large number of concurrent requests can also result in the service failing if it's unable to handle the contention these requests cause.
Solution, Refactor the solution and introduce a queue between the task and the service.</p>

<p>The Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern is designed to handle intermittent heavy loads by using a queue as a buffer between a task and a service it invokes. Here are some issues and considerations associated with this pattern</p>
<ul>
<li>Rate Control - It is necessary to implement application logic that controls the rate at which services handle messages to avoid overwhelming the target resource. This involves ensuring that spikes in demand are not passed to the next stage of the system</li>
<li>Testing Under Load - The system should be tested under load to ensure that it provides the required leveling. Adjustments may be needed in the number of queues and the number of service instances that handle messages to achieve optimal performance</li>
<li>Scalability - The pattern can help maximize scalability because both the number of queues and the number of services can be varied to meet demand. However, careful management is required to ensure that the system scales effectively without introducing bottlenecks</li>
<li>Availability - This pattern can help maximize availability because delays in services won't have an immediate and direct impact on the application. The application can continue to post messages to the queue even when the service isn't available or isn't currently processing messages</li>
<li>Cost Control - The number of service instances deployed only needs to be adequate to meet the average load rather than the peak load, which can help control costs. However, this requires careful monitoring and adjustment to ensure that the system remains cost-effective while meeting performance requirements</li>
<li>Throttling - Some services implement throttling when demand reaches a threshold beyond which the system could fail. Implementing load-leveling with these services can ensure that this threshold isn't reached, thereby maintaining service functionality</li>
<li>Temporal Decoupling - A message broker provides temporal decoupling, meaning the producer and consumer do not have to run concurrently. This allows the producer to send messages regardless of the consumer's availability, and the consumer can process messages at its own pace</li>
<li>Asynchronous Processing — The pattern supports asynchronous message processing, which can help maintain the responsiveness of the user interface and distribute processing across multiple servers to improve throughput. By considering these issues and implementing appropriate strategies, the Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern can effectively manage load and improve a system's resilience and scalability.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern should be used in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handling Intermittent Heavy Loads - When a service is subjected to intermittent heavy loads that can cause performance or reliability issues, this pattern helps to smooth out these loads by using a queue as a buffer between the task and the service it invokes</li>
<li>Decoupling Tasks from Services - When you need to decouple tasks from services to allow the service to handle messages at its own pace, regardless of the volume of requests from concurrent tasks. This ensures that the service is not overwhelmed by a sudden spike in demand</li>
<li>Maximizing Availability - When you want to ensure that delays in services do not have an immediate and direct impact on the application. The application can continue to post messages to the queue even when the service isn't available or isn't currently processing messages</li>
<li>Maximizing Scalability - When you need to scale both the number of queues and the number of services to meet demand. This pattern allows for flexible scaling to handle varying loads</li>
<li>Cost Control - When you want to control costs by deploying a number of service instances that only need to be adequate to meet the average load rather than the peak load. This can help in reducing the overall cost of the system</li>
<li>Throttling - When services implement throttling to prevent system failure due to high demand. The Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern can help ensure that the demand does not exceed the service's capacity, thereby maintaining functionality</li>
<li>Asynchronous Processing — When you need to perform tasks asynchronously to maintain the responsiveness of the user interface and distribute processing across multiple servers to improve throughput, you can use the Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern in these scenarios to improve your system's resilience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Publisher-Subscriber, or PubSub for short, enables an application to announce events to multiple interested consumers asynchronously without coupling the senders to the receivers.</p>
<p>In cloud-based and distributed applications, system components often need to provide information to other components as events occur.
Asynchronous messaging is an effective way to decouple senders from consumers and avoid blocking the sender from waiting for a response. The sender uses an input messaging channel. The sender packages events into messages, using a known message format, and sends these messages via the input channel. The sender in this pattern is also called the&nbsp;publisher.</p>
<p>One output messaging channel per consumer. The consumers are known as&nbsp;subscribers.
A mechanism for copying each message from the input channel to the output channels for all subscribers interested in that message. This operation is typically handled by an intermediary such as a message broker or event bus.</p>

<p>The Publisher-Subscriber pattern, also known as Pub-Sub, is a messaging pattern where an application (publisher) sends messages or events to multiple interested consumers (subscribers) asynchronously. Here are some issues and considerations associated with this pattern</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalability - One of the main challenges is ensuring the system can scale efficiently as the number of subscribers increases. Each new subscriber typically requires additional resources and potentially changes to the application code to handle the new message queue</li>
<li>Message Delivery - Ensuring that messages are delivered to all subscribers reliably and in a timely manner can be complex. Message queues generally aim to deliver messages in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner, but this order is not always guaranteed, especially under high-load conditions</li>
<li>Monitoring and Alerts - Implementing effective monitoring and alerting mechanisms is crucial to tracking the performance of message queues, detecting stuck messages, and ensuring that subscribers are processing messages efficiently</li>
<li>Security - Ensuring that messages are encrypted and only authorized subscribers can access them is essential. This involves implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms</li>
<li>Handling Subscriptions - Deciding how to manage subscriptions is important. You need to determine whether subscribers can subscribe and unsubscribe at their own pace or if an approval mechanism is required</li>
<li>Message Duplication - Handling duplicate messages is necessary because message queues guarantee at least one delivery, which means there is a chance that a message might be delivered more than once. Implementing deduplication mechanisms can help manage this issue</li>
<li>Poison Messages - Managing poison messages, which are messages that repeatedly fail to be processed, is important. These messages should be moved to a separate poison queue to free up the main queue for other messages</li>
<li>One-Way Communication - The Pub-Sub pattern is inherently one-way, meaning that subscribers cannot send acknowledgments or responses back to the publisher. If two-way communication is needed, another pattern like Request-Reply should be implemented</li>
<li>Message Expiration - Defining how long messages should remain in the queue before they expire is important. This helps in managing the lifecycle of messages and ensuring that outdated messages do not clog the system</li>
<li>Wildcard Subscriptions — Implementing wildcard subscriptions can allow subscribers to subscribe to all topics with a single action, simplifying the management of multiple topics. By addressing these issues and considerations, the Publisher-Subscriber pattern can be effectively implemented to enable scalable, reliable, and secure asynchronous communication between publishers and multiple subscribers.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-to-use-this-pattern-6">When to use this pattern<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/cloud-design-patterns/#when-to-use-this-pattern-6" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When to use this pattern" title="Direct link to When to use this pattern">​</a></h5>
<p>The Publisher-Subscriber (Pub-Sub) pattern should be used in the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadcasting Information to Multiple Consumers - When you need to send the same information to multiple consumers simultaneously, the Pub-Sub pattern is ideal. This allows a single publisher to broadcast messages to multiple subscribers without needing to send individual messages to each one</li>
<li>Decoupling Senders and Receivers - When you want to decouple the senders of messages from the receivers, enabling them to operate independently. This is useful in systems where the publisher does not need to know about the subscribers and vice versa</li>
<li>Asynchronous Communication - When you need to enable asynchronous communication between different parts of a system. This allows the publisher to send messages without waiting for the subscribers to process them, improving the overall responsiveness and scalability of the system</li>
<li>Event-Driven Architectures - When implementing event-driven architectures where components need to react to events as they happen. The Pub-Sub pattern allows for real-time event propagation to multiple interested parties</li>
<li>Handling Real-Time Notifications - When you need to provide real-time notifications to multiple subscribers, such as in monitoring systems, alerting mechanisms or live data feeds</li>
<li>Scalability and Flexibility - When you need a scalable and flexible system where new subscribers can be added without modifying the publisher. This allows the system to grow and adapt to new requirements easily</li>
<li>Filtering and Routing Messages — When you need to filter and route messages to specific subscribers based on certain criteria, you can use topics and content filtering mechanisms. By using the Publisher-Subscriber pattern in these scenarios, you can create a robust, scalable, and flexible messaging system that efficiently handles communication between different components.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Decouple backend processing from a frontend host, where backend processing needs to be asynchronous, but the frontend still needs a clear response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In modern application development, it's normal for client applications — often code running in a web client (browser) — to depend on remote APIs to provide business logic and compose functionality. In most cases, APIs for a client network infrastructure are largely out of the control of the application developer. Most APIs can respond quickly enough for responses to arrive back over the same connection. Application code can make a synchronous API call in a non-blocking way, giving the appearance of asynchronous processing, which is recommended for I/O-bound operations.
In some scenarios, however, the work done by the backend may be long-running, on the order of seconds, or might be a background process that is executed in minutes or even hours. In that case, it isn't feasible to wait for the work to complete before responding to the request. This situation is a potential problem for any synchronous request-reply pattern. Applications are designed to respond quickly, on the order of 100 ms or less.&nbsp;
One solution to this problem is to use HTTP polling. Polling is useful to client-side code, as it can be hard to provide call-back endpoints or use long-running connections. Even when callbacks are possible, the extra libraries and services that are required can sometimes add too much extra complexity.</p>

<p>The Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern is used to decouple backend processing from a frontend host, where backend processing needs to be asynchronous, but the frontend still needs a clear response. Here are some issues and considerations associated with this pattern</p>
<ul>
<li>Latency and Response Time - The pattern is designed to handle scenarios where backend processing is long-running. However, this introduces latency in the response time, as the client has to poll for the result of the long-running operation. This can affect the user experience if not managed properly</li>
<li>Polling Mechanism - Implementing an efficient polling mechanism is crucial. The HTTP02 response should indicate the location and frequency that the client should poll for the response. This helps in managing the load on the server and ensures that the client does not overwhelm the server with frequent polling requests</li>
<li>Handling Long-Running Operations - The backend must be capable of handling long-running operations efficiently. This includes offloading processing to another component, such as a message queue, and ensuring that the status endpoint can accurately reflect the progress of the operation</li>
<li>Error Handling - Proper error handling mechanisms need to be in place. If an error occurs during processing, the error should persist at the resource URL described in the location header, and the appropriate response code (HTTP 4xx) should be returned. This ensures that the client is aware of any issues and can take appropriate action</li>
<li>Status Codes and Redirects - The API should return the correct status codes based on the state of the operation. For example, upon successful processing, the API should return HTTP00 (OK), HTTP01 (Created), or HTTP04 (No Content). If the status endpoint redirects on completion, HTTP 302 or HTTP 303 should be used</li>
<li>Client-Side Considerations - The client-side code must be designed to handle asynchronous responses. This includes managing the polling logic, handling different status codes, and updating the user interface based on the progress and completion of the operation</li>
<li>Scalability - The pattern allows the client process and the backend API to scale independently. However, this separation also brings additional complexity when the client requires success notification, as this step needs to become asynchronous</li>
<li>Security - Ensuring secure communication between the client and the server is essential. This includes validating both the request and the action to be performed before starting the long-running process and ensuring that sensitive data is protected during transmission</li>
<li>Legacy Clients - Some legacy clients might not support this pattern. It is important to consider the compatibility of the pattern with existing clients and whether additional support or alternative solutions are needed for those clients</li>
<li>Resource Management - Efficiently managing resources such as message queues and status endpoints is crucial to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure the system can handle many concurrent requests. By addressing these issues and considerations, the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern can be effectively implemented to handle long-running operations while providing a clear response to the client.</li>

<p>The Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern should be used in the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Long-Running Backend Operations - When the backend processing is long-running, taking seconds, minutes, or even hours, and it is not feasible to keep the client waiting for the operation to complete. This pattern allows the client to initiate the request and then poll for the result later</li>
<li>Decoupling Frontend and Backend - When you need to decouple the frontend host from the backend processing. This is useful in scenarios where the frontend needs a clear response, but the backend processing needs to be asynchronous</li>
<li>Scalability - When you want to enable the client process and the backend API to scale independently. By using a message broker to separate the request and response stages, you can achieve better scalability and manage load more effectively</li>
<li>Handling High Latency - When factors such as network infrastructure, geographic location, or current load can add significant latency to the response. The pattern helps mitigate these issues by allowing the backend to process the request asynchronously and the client to poll for the result</li>
<li>Microservices Architectures - When implementing microservices architectures where server-to-server REST API calls are common. The pattern helps manage long-running operations and decouples services, making the system more resilient and scalable</li>
<li>Client-Side Polling - When it is difficult to provide call-back endpoints or use long-running connections on the client side. The pattern allows the client to poll for the result, which can be simpler and more efficient in certain scenariosBy using the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern in these scenarios, you can effectively manage long-running operations, improve scalability, and decouple frontend and backend processing, leading to a more robust and responsive system.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Handle faults that might take a variable amount of time to recover from when connecting to a remote service or resource. This can improve an application's stability and resiliency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a distributed environment, calls to remote resources and services can fail due to transient faults, such as slow network connections, timeouts, or the resources being overcommitted or temporarily unavailable. These faults typically correct themselves after a short period of time, and a robust cloud application should be prepared to handle them by using a strategy such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/cloud-native/application-resiliency-patterns?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796#retry-pattern" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retry pattern</a>.
However, there can also be situations where faults are due to unanticipated events, and that might take much longer to fix. These faults can range in severity from a partial loss of connectivity to the complete failure of a service. In these situations, it might be pointless for an application to retry an operation that is unlikely to succeed continually, and instead, the application should quickly accept that the operation has failed and handle this failure accordingly. Additionally, if a service is very busy, failure in one part of the system might lead to cascading failures. The purpose of the Circuit Breaker pattern is different than the Retry pattern. The Retry pattern enables an application to retry an operation in the expectation that it'll succeed. The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents an application from performing an operation that is likely to fail. An application can combine these two patterns by using the Retry pattern to invoke an operation through a circuit breaker. However, the retry logic should be sensitive to any exceptions returned by the circuit breaker and abandon retry attempts if the circuit breaker indicates that a fault is not transient. The failure counter used by the&nbsp;Closed&nbsp;state is time-based. It's automatically reset at periodic intervals. This helps to prevent the circuit breaker from entering the&nbsp;Open&nbsp;state if it experiences occasional failures.</p>

<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="issues--considerations-12">Issues &amp; considerations<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/cloud-design-patterns/#issues--considerations-12" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Issues &amp; considerations" title="Direct link to Issues &amp; considerations">​</a></h5>
<p>The Circuit Breaker pattern is designed to handle faults that might take a variable amount of time to recover from, especially when connecting to remote services or resources. Here are some issues and considerations associated with this pattern</p>
<ul>
<li>State Management - The Circuit Breaker pattern typically involves three states: Closed, Open, and Half-Open. Managing these states correctly is crucial. The Closed state allows normal operation, the Open state immediately fails requests, and the Half-Open state allows a limited number of test requests to check if the issue has been resolved</li>
<li>Thresholds and Timeouts - Setting appropriate thresholds for the number of failures and timeouts is essential. If the thresholds are too low, the circuit breaker might open too frequently, causing unnecessary failures. If they are too high, the system might not protect itself effectively from cascading failures</li>
<li>Recovery Testing - In the Open state, the circuit breaker should periodically test the service to see if it has recovered. This can be done using a timer or by pinging the service. The interval for these tests should be carefully chosen based on the criticality of the operation and the nature of the service&nbsp;</li>
<li>Manual Override - Providing a manual override option can be beneficial in systems where the recovery time for a failing operation is extremely variable. This allows administrators to manually reset the circuit breaker or force it into the Open state as needed</li>
<li>Concurrency - The circuit breaker might be accessed by a large number of concurrent instances of an application. The implementation should ensure that it does not block concurrent requests or add excessive overhead to each call</li>
<li>Resource Differentiation - Using a single circuit breaker for multiple underlying independent providers can be problematic. For example, in a data store with multiple shards, one shard might be accessible while another is experiencing issues. The circuit breaker should differentiate between these resources to avoid unnecessary failures</li>
<li>Accelerated Circuit Breaking - Sometimes, a failure response can provide enough information for the circuit breaker to trip immediately and stay tripped for a minimum amount of time. For example, an overloaded shared resource might indicate that an immediate retry is not recommended</li>
<li>Replaying Failed Requests - In the Open state, the circuit breaker could record the details of each failed request and arrange for these requests to be replayed when the service becomes available again. This ensures that important operations are not lost</li>
<li>Inappropriate Timeouts - The circuit breaker might not fully protect applications from operations that fail in external services configured with lengthy timeouts. If the timeout is too long, a thread running the circuit breaker might be blocked for an extended period, tying up resources</li>
<li>Impact on Shared Resources - Aggressive retry policies can cause an increasing number of transient faults for other users and applications sharing the same resources. It is important to consider the impact of the circuit breaker on shared resources and other tenants in a multi-tenant environment. Addressing these issues and considerations, the Circuit Breaker pattern can be effectively implemented to improve the stability and resiliency of an application, preventing cascading failures and managing long-lasting faults efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-to-use-this-pattern-8">When to use this pattern<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/cloud-design-patterns/#when-to-use-this-pattern-8" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When to use this pattern" title="Direct link to When to use this pattern">​</a></h5>
<p>The Circuit Breaker pattern should be used in the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Handling Persistent or Non-Transient Errors - When an application encounters persistent or non-transient errors, such as a service being down or a network failure, the Circuit Breaker pattern can prevent the application from continually trying to perform an operation that is likely to fail</li>
<li>Preventing Resource Exhaustion - If a service is frequently unavailable or busy, it might be due to resource exhaustion. The Circuit Breaker pattern helps to prevent further strain on the service by stopping additional requests until the service has had time to recover</li>
<li>Improving System Stability - The pattern provides stability while the system recovers from a failure and minimizes the impact on performance. It quickly rejects requests for operations that are likely to fail rather than waiting for them to time out or never return</li>
<li>Managing Long-Lasting Faults - When faults are likely to be long-lasting or terminal, the Circuit Breaker pattern can handle these faults as exceptions. The application can log the exception and try to continue by invoking an alternative service or offering degraded functionality</li>
<li>Avoiding Cascading Failures - The pattern helps mitigate failures and avoid cascading failures disrupting the entire application. By stopping requests to a failing service, it prevents the failure from propagating to other parts of the system</li>
<li>Testing Service Recovery - The Circuit Breaker pattern allows the application to periodically test the service to detect when it becomes available again. This can be done on an intermittent basis with long intervals between requests, depending on the criticality of the operation and the nature of the service</li>
<li>Logging and Monitoring—The pattern can be used to log all failed requests and monitor the operation's health. This information can be used to alert administrators when a circuit breaker trips to the Open state, providing insights into the system's health. Using the Circuit Breaker pattern in these scenarios, you can improve the resiliency and stability of your application, prevent resource exhaustion, and manage long-lasting faults effectively.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The deployment stamp pattern involves provisioning, managing, and monitoring a heterogeneous group of resources to host and operate multiple workloads or tenants. Each individual copy is called a&nbsp;stamp or sometimes a&nbsp;service unit,&nbsp;scale unit, or&nbsp;cell. In a multitenant environment, every stamp or scale unit can serve a predefined number of tenants. Multiple stamps can be deployed to scale the solution almost linearly and serve an increasing number of tenants. This approach can improve the scalability of your solution, allow you to deploy instances across multiple regions, and separate your customer data. consider grouping resources in&nbsp;scale units&nbsp;and provisioning multiple copies of your&nbsp;stamps. Each&nbsp;scale unit&nbsp;will host and serve a subset of your tenants. Stamps operate independently of each other and can be deployed and updated independently. A single geographical region might contain a single stamp or might contain multiple stamps to allow for horizontal scale-out within the region.&nbsp;</p>

<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="issues--considerations-13">Issues &amp; considerations<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/cloud-design-patterns/#issues--considerations-13" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Issues &amp; considerations" title="Direct link to Issues &amp; considerations">​</a></h5>
<p>Several issues and considerations need to be addressed when implementing the deployment stamp pattern to ensure a successful deployment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployment Process - It's crucial to have automated and fully repeatable deployment processes. Tools like Bicep, JSON ARM templates, or Terraform modules can be used to declaratively define your stamps and keep the definitions consistent</li>
<li>Cross-Stamp Operations - When your solution is deployed across multiple stamps, operations that span multiple stamps, such as aggregating customer data, can become complex. Queries might need to be executed against each stamp, and the results aggregated. Alternatively, consider having all stamps publish data into a centralized data warehouse for consolidated reporting</li>
<li>Determining Scale-Out Policies - Stamps have a finite capacity, which might be defined using a proxy metric such as the number of tenants that can be deployed to the stamp. It's important to monitor the available and used capacity for each stamp and proactively deploy additional stamps to accommodate new tenants</li>
<li>Minimum Number of Stamps - It's advisable to deploy at least two stamps of your solution to avoid hard-coding assumptions in your code or configuration that won't apply when you scale out</li>
<li>Cost - Deploying multiple copies of your infrastructure components will likely involve a substantial increase in the cost of operating your solution. This includes the cost of additional memory, compute, and other resources required for each stamp2&nbsp;</li>
<li>Moving Between Stamps - Each stamp is deployed and operated independently, so moving tenants between stamps can be difficult. Custom logic is needed to transmit customer information to a different stamp and remove it from the original stamp. This process might require a backplane for communication between stamps, further increasing the complexity of the solution</li>
<li>Traffic Routing - Routing traffic to the correct stamp for a given request can require an additional component to resolve tenants to stamps. This component needs to be highly available to ensure reliable traffic routing</li>
<li>Shared Components - Some components might be shared across stamps. For example, a shared single-page app for all tenants could be deployed in one region and replicated globally using Azure CDN</li>
<li>Geographical Distribution - For multi-region applications, each tenant's data and traffic should be directed to a specific region. This ensures that requests are routed to the correct stamp based on the user's geographical location</li>
<li>Resiliency During Outages - Stamps are independent of one another, so if an outage affects a single stamp, tenants deployed to other stamps should not be affected. This isolation helps to contain the 'blast radius' of an incident or outage</li>
<li>Handling Single and Multi-Tenant Instances - The pattern should support both single and multi-tenant instances, ensuring that each tenant's data is isolated and secure</li>
<li>Update Frequency — Different stamps might need to be on different versions of your solution at the same time. This requires careful management of updates and version control across stamps. By considering these issues and implementing appropriate strategies, the Deployment Stamp pattern can effectively improve the scalability, resiliency, and manageability of your solution.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-to-use-this-pattern-9">When to use this pattern<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/cloud-design-patterns/#when-to-use-this-pattern-9" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When to use this pattern" title="Direct link to When to use this pattern">​</a></h5>
<p>The Deployment Stamp pattern is useful in the following scenarios</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural Limits on Scalability - If certain components of your system cannot or should not scale beyond a specific number of customers or requests, the Deployment Stamp pattern allows you to scale out by deploying multiple instances (stamps) of your solution</li>
<li>Tenant Isolation - When there is a requirement to separate certain tenants from others due to security concerns or compliance requirements, the Deployment Stamp pattern can be used to deploy these tenants onto their own isolated stamps</li>
<li>Multi-Region Applications - For applications that need to be deployed across multiple regions, each tenant's data and traffic can be directed to a specific region. This ensures that requests are routed to the correct stamp based on the user's geographical location</li>
<li>Resiliency During Outages - Stamps are independent of one another, so if an outage affects a single stamp, tenants deployed to other stamps should not be affected. This isolation helps to contain the 'blast radius' of an incident or outage, enhancing the overall resiliency of the application</li>
<li>Different Versions of the Solution - If there is a need to have some tenants on different versions of your solution at the same time, the Deployment Stamp pattern allows for this flexibility by deploying different stamps with different versions</li>
<li>High-Scale Platforms — The pattern is suitable for implementing high-scale platforms with users distributed over a wide area. It helps manage the load and ensure that the system can handle a large number of users efficiently. By using the Deployment Stamp pattern in these scenarios, you can achieve better scalability, isolation, and resiliency for your application.</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The Bulkhead pattern is a type of application design that is tolerant of failure. In a bulkhead architecture, elements of an application are isolated into pools so that if one fails, the others will continue to function. It's named after the sectioned partitions (bulkheads) of a ship's hull. If the hull of a ship is compromised, only the damaged section fills with water, which prevents the ship from sinking. A cloud-based application may include multiple services, with each service having one or more consumers. Excessive load or failure in a service will impact all consumers of the service. Partition service instances into different groups, based on consumer load and availability requirements. This design helps to isolate failures and allows you to sustain service functionality for some consumers, even during a failure.</p>
<p>The Bulkhead pattern and the Deployment Stamp pattern are both architectural patterns used to improve the resiliency and scalability of applications, but they address different concerns and are implemented in different ways, for example, the Deployment Stamp isolates entire instances of applications, each with its own services, the bulkhead partner isolates different components or services within the same application or system and is primarily focuses on fault isolation and resource management within a single deployment. These patterns can work together for a highly resistant solution.</p>

<p>The Bulkhead pattern is designed to improve the resiliency of an application by isolating different parts of the system to prevent a failure in one part from cascading to others. Here are the key issues and considerations when implementing the Bulkhead pattern
Issues</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource Exhaustion - If a service or consumer fails or becomes misconfigured, it can exhaust resources such as connection pools, memory, or CPU. This can prevent other services or consumers from functioning properly.</li>
<li>Cascading Failures - Without isolation, a failure in one service can lead to cascading failures, affecting the entire system. This can happen if a single service consumes all available resources, leaving none for other services.</li>
<li>Complexity - Implementing the Bulkhead pattern adds complexity to the system. It requires careful planning and management of resource allocation and isolation.</li>
<li>Less Efficient Use of Resources - Isolating resources for different services or consumers can lead to less efficient use of resources. For example, some resources might remain underutilized while others are overutilized
Considerations</li>
<li>Partitioning Services and Consumers — Services and consumers should be divided into different groups based on load and availability requirements. This helps isolate failures and maintain service functionality for some consumers even during a failure.</li>
<li>Resource Allocation - Allocate separate resources (e.g., connection pools, memory) for each service or consumer. This ensures that a failure in one service does not affect the resources available to other services.</li>
<li>Granularity of Bulkheads - Determine the appropriate level of granularity for bulkheads. For example, you could isolate resources at the service level, consumer level, or even at the tenant level.</li>
<li>Combining with Other Patterns - Consider combining the Bulkhead pattern with other fault-handling patterns such as retry, circuit breaker, and throttling to provide more sophisticated fault handling.</li>
<li>Technology Overhead - Evaluate the overhead in terms of cost, performance, and manageability when partitioning services or consumers into bulkheads. For example, using containers can offer a good balance of resource isolation with fairly low overhead.</li>
<li>Monitoring and SLA - Monitor the performance and SLA of each partition to ensure that the isolation is effective and that resources are being used efficiently.</li>
<li>Critical vs. Standard Consumers - Isolate critical consumers from standard consumers to ensure that critical operations can continue even if standard operations fail.</li>
<li>Security—The segmentation between components helps constrain security incidents to the compromised bulkhead, enhancing the overall security of the system. By addressing these issues and considerations, the Bulkhead pattern can help improve the resiliency and reliability of your application, ensuring that failures are contained and do not affect the entire system.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-to-use-this-pattern-10">When to use this pattern<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/cloud-design-patterns/#when-to-use-this-pattern-10" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When to use this pattern" title="Direct link to When to use this pattern">​</a></h5>
<p>The Bulkhead pattern is particularly useful in the following scenarios</p>
<ul>
<li>Isolating Resources for Backend Services - Use the Bulkhead pattern to isolate resources used to consume a set of backend services. This is especially important if the application can provide some level of functionality even when one of the services is not responding</li>
<li>Isolating Critical Consumers from Standard Consumers - Implement the Bulkhead pattern to isolate critical consumers from standard consumers. This ensures that critical operations can continue even if standard operations fail</li>
<li>Protecting the Application from Cascading Failures - The Bulkhead pattern helps protect the application from cascading failures. By isolating different parts of the system, a failure in one part does not affect the entire system</li>
<li>Handling Resource Exhaustion - When a service or consumer fails or becomes misconfigured, it can exhaust resources such as connection pools, memory, or CPU. The Bulkhead pattern helps to prevent this by isolating resources for different services or consumers</li>
<li>Maintaining Service Functionality During Failures - The Bulkhead pattern allows you to sustain service functionality for some consumers even during a failure. By partitioning service instances into different groups based on consumer load and availability requirements, you can isolate failures and maintain service functionality</li>
<li>Combining with Other Fault-Handling Patterns - Consider combining the Bulkhead pattern with other fault-handling patterns such as retry, circuit breaker, and throttling to provide more sophisticated fault-handling</li>
<li>Deploying Services with Different Quality of Service - The Bulkhead pattern allows you to deploy services that offer a different quality of service for consuming applications. For example, a high-priority consumer pool can be configured to use high-priority services. By using the Bulkhead pattern in these scenarios, you can improve the resiliency and reliability of your application, ensuring that failures are contained and do not affect the entire system.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>If one or more of the steps fail, you can use the Compensating Transaction pattern to undo the work that the steps performed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you use an eventually consistent operation that consists of a series of steps, the Compensating Transaction pattern can be useful. Specifically, if one or more of the steps fail, you can use the Compensating Transaction pattern to undo the work that the steps performed. Typically, you find operations that follow the eventual consistency model in cloud-hosted applications that implement complex business processes and workflows. Applications that run in the cloud frequently modify data. This data is sometimes spread across various data sources in different geographic locations. To avoid contention and improve performance in a distributed environment, an application shouldn't try to provide strong transactional consistency. Rather, the application should implement eventual consistency. In the eventual consistency model, a typical business operation consists of a series of separate steps. While the operation performs these steps, the overall view of the system state might be inconsistent. But when the operation finishes and all the steps have run, the system should become consistent again. The data that are affected by an operation that implements eventual consistency isn't always held in a database. For example, consider a service-oriented architecture (SOA) environment. An SOA operation can invoke an action in a service and cause a change in the state that's held by that service.</p>
<p>To undo the operation, you also have to undo this state change. This process can involve invoking the service again and performing another action that reverses the effects of the first.</p>
<p>The solution is to implement a compensating transaction. The steps in a compensating transaction undo the effects of the steps in the original operation. An intuitive approach is to replace the current state with the state the system was in at the start of the operation. But a compensating transaction can't always take that approach, because it might overwrite changes that other concurrent instances of an application have made. Instead, a compensating transaction must be an intelligent process that takes into account any work that concurrent instances do. This process is usually application-specific, driven by the nature of the work that the original operation performs.</p>

<p>When implementing the Compensating Transaction pattern, there are several issues and considerations to keep in mind</p>
<ul>
<li>Determining Failure - It might not be easy to determine when a step in an operation that implements eventual consistency fails. A step might not fail immediately but could get blocked. Implementing a time-out mechanism can help identify such failures</li>
<li>Complexity of Compensation Logic - Compensation logic is often application-specific and relies on the application having sufficient information to undo the effects of each step in a failed operation. Generalizing this logic can be challenging</li>
<li>Idempotency - Define the steps in a compensating transaction as idempotent commands. This ensures that the steps can be repeated if the compensating transaction itself fails, which is crucial for maintaining consistency</li>
<li>Resilience and Reliability - The infrastructure handling the steps must be resilient both in the original operation and in the compensating transaction. It should not lose the information required to compensate for a failing step and must reliably monitor the progress of the compensation logic</li>
<li>State Restoration - A compensating transaction doesn't necessarily return the system data to its state at the start of the original operation. Instead, it compensates for the work that the operation completed successfully before it failed</li>
<li>Order of Steps - The order of the steps in the compensating transaction isn't necessarily the exact opposite of the steps in the original operation. For example, one data store might be more sensitive to inconsistencies than another, so the steps that undo changes to this store should occur first</li>
<li>Concurrency and Parallelism - It might be possible to perform some of the undo steps in parallel, depending on how the compensating logic is designed for each step. This can help speed up the compensation process</li>
<li>Manual Intervention - In some cases, manual intervention might be the only way to recover from a step that has failed. The system should raise an alert and provide as much information as possible about the reason for the failure</li>
<li>Resource Locking - To increase the likelihood of overall activity success, you can place a short-term, time-out–based lock on each resource required to complete an operation. Obtain these resources in advance and perform the work only after acquiring all the resources, finalizing all actions before the locks expire</li>
<li>Retry Logic - Implement retry logic that is more forgiving than usual to minimize failures that trigger a compensating transaction. If a step in an operation fails, handle the failure as a transient exception and repeat the step. Stop the operation and initiate a compensating transaction only if a step fails repeatedly or can't be recovered. By considering these issues and implementing appropriate strategies, you can effectively manage the complexities associated with compensating transactions and ensure the reliability and consistency of your application.</li>

<p>The Compensating Transaction pattern should be used in the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Undoing Operations in Eventual Consistency Models - Use this pattern to undo operations that implement the eventual consistency model. This is particularly useful when you need to maintain data consistency across distributed systems</li>
<li>Handling Failures in Long-Running Transactions - When dealing with long-running transactions that involve multiple steps, the Compensating Transaction pattern can be used to undo the effects of each step if the transaction fails at any point. This ensures that the system can recover gracefully from failures</li>
<li>Ensuring Reliability and Resilience - Implement this pattern to address malfunctions in critical workload paths by rolling back data changes, breaking transaction locks, or executing native system behavior to reverse the effect. This helps make the workload resilient to malfunctions and ensures it recovers to a fully functioning state after a failure</li>
<li>Complex Business Processes and Workflows - Use the Compensating Transaction pattern in cloud-hosted applications that implement complex business processes and workflows. This pattern helps in managing eventual consistency and ensuring that the system can handle failures effectively</li>
<li>Avoiding the Complexity of Distributed Transactions - When it is not feasible to use distributed transactions due to their complexity and overhead, the Compensating Transaction pattern can be an alternative. It allows you to break down a distributed transaction into separate, compensable tasks</li>
<li>Handling State Changes in Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) - In an SOA environment, where operations can cause changes in the state held by services, the Compensating Transaction pattern can be used to undo these state changes if necessary</li>
<li>Manual Intervention and Recovery - In cases where manual intervention might be required to recover from a failed step, the Compensating Transaction pattern can be used to raise alerts and provide information about the failure, allowing for manual recovery actions using the Compensating Transaction pattern in these scenarios, you can ensure that your system can handle failures gracefully, maintain data consistency, and recover from errors effectively.</li>

<p>Customers use a travel website to book itineraries. A single itinerary might consist of a series of flights and hotels. A customer who travels from Seattle to London and then on to Paris might perform the following steps when creating an itinerary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Book a seat on flight F1 from Seattle to London.</li>
<li>Book a seat on flight F2 from London to Paris.
3 Book a seat on flight F3 from Paris to Seattle.</li>
<li>Reserve a room at Hotel H1 in London.</li>
<li>Reserve a room at Hotel H2 in Paris.</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps constitute an eventually consistent operation, although each step is a separate action. In addition to performing these steps, the system must also record the counter operations for undoing each step. This information is needed in case the customer cancels the itinerary. The steps necessary to perform the counter operations can then run as a compensating transaction.</p>
<p>In many business solutions, failure of a single step doesn't always necessitate rolling back the system by using a compensating transaction. For example, consider the travel website scenario. Suppose the customer books flights F1, F2, and F3 but can't reserve a room at Hotel H1. It's preferable to offer the customer a room at a different hotel in the same city rather than canceling the flights. The customer can still decide to cancel. In that case, the compensating transaction runs and undoes the bookings for flights F1, F2, and F3. But the customer should make this decision, not the system.</p>

<p>Create separate backend services to be consumed by specific frontend applications or interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Backends for Frontends (BFF) pattern involves creating separate backend services tailored to specific frontend applications or interfaces. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to avoid customizing a single backend for multiple interfaces, which can lead to conflicting requirements and development bottlenecks. An application may initially target a desktop web UI, with a backend service developed to support it. As the user base grows, a mobile application might be developed that needs to interact with the same backend. However, the capabilities and requirements of mobile devices differ significantly from desktop browsers, leading to competing requirements for the backend.

<p>When implementing the Backends for Frontends (BFF) pattern, there are several issues and considerations to keep in mind
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Competing Requirements - Different frontends (e.g., desktop web UI and mobile applications) have varying requirements in terms of screen size, performance, and display limitations. These differences can lead to competing requirements for the backend, making it challenging to serve both interfaces effectively</li>
<li>Development Bottlenecks - The backend can become a bottleneck in the development process due to the need to accommodate conflicting update requirements from different front-end teams. This can result in significant effort being spent on maintaining a single deployable resource that serves multiple frontends</li>
<li>Complexity in Maintenance - Maintaining separate backends for each frontend can increase the complexity of the system. Each backend needs to be updated and maintained independently, which can lead to increased operational overhead
Considerations</li>
<li>Segmentation and Isolation - The BFF pattern introduces segmentation and isolation by creating separate backend services for each frontend. This reduces the surface area of the API and limits lateral movement among different backends, which might expose different capabilities</li>
<li>Tailored Security and Authorization - The separation allows for tailored security and authorization mechanisms for each front end. This ensures that the security requirements for each frontend are addressed effectively, potentially reducing the surface area of an API</li>
<li>Optimized Interfaces - By creating separate backends for each client, you can expose an optimal interface for that client. This allows for different payload sizes or interaction patterns that are specific to the needs of each front, improving performance and user experience</li>
<li>Reduced Attack Surface - The BFF pattern reduces the attack surface by limiting the functionality exposed by each backend to only what is necessary for its corresponding front end. This minimizes the potential for security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Enhanced Monitoring and Control - The separation of backends allows for more granular monitoring and control over each service. Security incidents can be contained within the specific backend, reducing the blast radius of any potential compromise</li>
<li>Compliance and Regulatory Requirements - Different frontends might have different compliance and regulatory requirements. The BFF pattern allows for these requirements to be addressed individually, ensuring that each backend complies with the necessary standards By considering these issues and implementing appropriate strategies, you can effectively manage the complexities associated with the Backends for Frontends pattern and ensure the reliability, security, and performance of your application.</li>
</ul>

It allows each backend to be optimized for the specific needs of its corresponding frontend</li>
<li>Security and Authorization - The BFF pattern is beneficial when you need to tailor security and authorization mechanisms for each front end. By individualizing the service layer for each front, you can reduce the surface area of the API and limit lateral movement among different backends, which might expose different capabilities</li>
<li>Optimized Interfaces - When you need to expose an optimal interface for each client, the BFF pattern is appropriate. This allows for different payload sizes or interaction patterns that are specific to the needs of each frontend, improving performance and user experience.

<blockquote>
<p>Protect applications and services by using a dedicated host instance to broker requests between clients and the application or service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cloud services expose endpoints that allow client applications to call their APIs. The code used to implement the APIs triggers or performs several tasks, including but not limited to authentication, authorization, parameter validation, and some or all request processing. The API code is likely to access storage and other services on behalf of the client.
If a malicious user compromises the system and gains access to the application's hosting environment, its security mechanisms and access to data and other services are exposed. As a result, the malicious user can gain unrestricted access to credentials, storage keys, sensitive information, and other services.</p>
<p>The GateKeeper patterns allow you to protect applications and services by using a dedicated host instance to broker requests between clients and the application or service. The broker validates and sanitizes the requests, and can provide an additional layer of security and limit the system's attack surface.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Cloud Design Pattern - Gatekeeper" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/Blog_CloudDesignPatterns_Gatekeeper-dfdbd58457930fd19f00df9155c09beb.gif" width="1903" height="1005" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>The Gatekeeper pattern is a design pattern used to protect applications and services by acting as an intermediary that validates and sanitizes requests before passing them to the trusted host. Here are the key issues and considerations when implementing this pattern
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Single Point of Failure - The gatekeeper instance could become a single point of failure. If the gatekeeper fails, it can disrupt the entire system. To mitigate this, consider deploying redundant instances and using an autoscaling mechanism to ensure capacity and maintain availability</li>
<li>Performance Impact - Adding the gatekeeper layer introduces additional processing and network communication, which can impact the overall performance of the system. This additional latency needs to be considered, especially for performance-critical applications</li>
<li>Complexity in Implementation - Implementing the gatekeeper pattern adds complexity to the system architecture. It requires careful design to ensure that the gatekeeper effectively validates and sanitizes requests without becoming a bottleneck or introducing new vulnerabilities
Considerations
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Controlled Validation - The gatekeeper should validate all incoming requests and reject those that do not meet the validation requirements. This helps in ensuring that only legitimate requests are processed by the trusted host</li>
<li>Limited Risk and Exposure - The gatekeeper should not have access to the credentials or keys used by the trusted host to access storage and services. This limits the risk and exposure in case the gatekeeper is compromised, as the attacker would not gain access to these sensitive credentials or keys</li>
<li>Appropriate Security - The gatekeeper should run in a limited privilege mode, while the rest of the application runs in full trust mode required to access storage and services. This ensures that even if the gatekeeper is compromised, it cannot directly access the application services or data</li>
<li>Secure Communication - Use secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS, SSL, or TLS) between the gatekeeper and the trusted hosts or tasks. This helps protect the data in transit and ensures that the communication between the gatekeeper and the trusted hosts is secure</li>
<li>Internal or Protected Endpoints - Ensure that the trusted hosts expose only internal or protected endpoints that are used exclusively by the gatekeeper. The trusted hosts should not expose any external endpoints or interfaces to minimize the attack surface</li>
<li>Redundant Instances - To minimize the impact of a failure, deploy redundant instances of the gatekeeper and use an autoscaling mechanism to ensure that there is always sufficient capacity to handle incoming requests</li>
<li>Separation of Concerns - The gatekeeper should not perform any processing related to the application or services or access any data. Its function should be purely to validate and sanitize requests. The trusted hosts might need to perform additional request validation, but the core validation should be done by the gatekeeper. By considering these issues and implementing appropriate strategies, you can effectively manage the complexities associated with the Gatekeeper pattern and ensure the reliability, security, and performance of your application.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-to-use-this-pattern-13">When to use this pattern<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/cloud-design-patterns/#when-to-use-this-pattern-13" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When to use this pattern" title="Direct link to When to use this pattern">​</a></h5>
<p>The Gatekeeper pattern should be used in the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Handling Sensitive Information - When your application handles sensitive information that requires a high degree of protection from malicious attacks, the Gatekeeper pattern is beneficial. It acts as an intermediary that validates and sanitizes requests before they reach the trusted host, thereby protecting sensitive data</li>
<li>High-Security Requirements - If your application exposes services that require robust security measures, such as web application firewalls, DDoS protection, bot detection, and centralized authentication and authorization checks, the Gatekeeper pattern can centralize these security functionalities</li>
<li>Mission-Critical Operations - For applications that perform mission-critical operations that cannot be disrupted, the Gatekeeper pattern ensures that only validated and sanitized requests are processed, reducing the risk of malicious attacks and system failures</li>
<li>Separate Request Validation - When there is a need to perform request validation separately from the main tasks or to centralize this validation to simplify maintenance and administration, the Gatekeeper pattern is appropriate. It ensures that the core validation is done by the gatekeeper, while the trusted hosts might perform additional validation</li>
<li>Reducing Attack Surface - The Gatekeeper pattern is useful when you want to reduce the attack surface of your system. By decoupling the public endpoints from the code that processes requests and accesses storage, the gatekeeper can provide an additional layer of security and limit the system's exposure to potential attacks</li>
<li>Secure Communication - When secure communication between clients and the application or service is required, the Gatekeeper pattern can be implemented using secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS, SSL, or TLS) between the gatekeeper and the trusted hosts or tasks</li>
<li>Redundancy and Availability - In scenarios where high availability is crucial, deploying redundant instances of the gatekeeper and using an autoscaling mechanism can ensure that there is always sufficient capacity to handle incoming requests, minimizing the impact of a failure using the Gatekeeper pattern in these scenarios, you can enhance the security, reliability, and performance of your application, ensuring that it meets the necessary protection and operational requirements.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Delegate authentication to an external identity provider. This can simplify development, minimize the requirement for user administration, and improve the user experience of the application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Users typically need to work with multiple applications provided and hosted by different organizations they have a business relationship with.</p>
<p>Implement an authentication mechanism that can use federated identity. Separate user authentication from the application code and delegate authentication to a trusted identity provider.</p>
<p>This model is often called claims-based access control. Applications and services authorize access to features and functionality based on the claims contained in the token. The service that requires authentication must trust the IdP. The client application contacts the IdP, which performs the authentication.</p>
<p>Federated authentication provides a standards-based solution to the issue of trusting identities across diverse domains,</p>
<p>This type of authentication is becoming more common across all types of applications, especially cloud-hosted applications because it supports single sign-on without requiring a direct network connection to identity providers. The user doesn't have to enter credentials for every application. This increases security because it prevents the creation of credentials required to access many different applications, and it also hides the user's credentials from all but the original identity provider. Applications see just the authenticated identity information contained within the token.</p>

<p>When implementing the Federated Identity pattern, there are several issues and considerations to keep in mind
Issues
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Single Point of Failure - Authentication can become a single point of failure. If the identity provider (IdP) or the Security Token Service (STS) fails, it can disrupt access to all applications relying on it. To mitigate this, consider deploying your identity management mechanism across multiple data centers to maintain reliability and availability</li>
<li>Complexity in Implementation - Implementing federated identity can be complex, especially if retrofitting it into existing applications that were built using different authentication mechanisms. This complexity can make it less cost-effective and more challenging to manage</li>
<li>Performance Impact - The additional steps involved in federated authentication, such as token issuance and validation, can introduce latency. This performance impact needs to be considered, especially for applications requiring high responsiveness</li>
<li>Security Vulnerabilities - Federated identity can expose security vulnerabilities if not properly managed. For example, if a user leaves the company and their account is not immediately deprovisioned, it can lead to unauthorized access. Ensuring timely de-provisioning and robust security practices is crucial</li>
<li>Administrative Overhead - While federated identity can reduce the administrative overhead of managing user credentials within the application, it requires careful management of the relationship with the identity provider. This includes ensuring that the identity provider's security practices are robust and that the integration is maintained.
&nbsp;* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Federated identity allows for the implementation of RBAC based on role claims contained in the authentication token. This provides a more granular level of control over access to features and resources within the application</li>
<li>Home Realm Discovery - If there are multiple identity providers configured, the STS must determine which identity provider the user should be redirected to for authentication. This process, known as home realm discovery, can be automated based on various factors such as email address, subdomain, IP address, or cookies</li>
<li>User Experience - Federated identity can improve the user experience by enabling single sign-on (SSO) across multiple applications. Users do not need to remember multiple credentials, which simplifies their interaction with the system and reduces the likelihood of forgotten passwords</li>
<li>Security and Compliance - Offloading user management and authentication to a trusted identity provider can enhance security by leveraging the provider's advanced capabilities for identity-based threat detection and prevention. This also helps in meeting compliance requirements without implementing these capabilities in the application itself</li>
<li>Business Continuity - Federated systems typically require a load-balanced array of servers to ensure high availability for authentication requests. This setup helps maintain business continuity by providing redundancy and failover capabilities</li>
<li>Integration with Third-Party Services - Federated identity is useful for integrating with third-party services and applications, especially in scenarios where multiple organizations need to collaborate. It allows users from different organizations to authenticate using their own credentials, simplifying access management. By considering these issues and implementing appropriate strategies, you can effectively manage the complexities associated with the Federated Identity pattern and ensure the reliability, security, and performance of your application.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-to-use-this-pattern-14">When to use this pattern<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/cloud-design-patterns/#when-to-use-this-pattern-14" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When to use this pattern" title="Direct link to When to use this pattern">​</a></h5>
<p>The Federated Identity pattern should be used in the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Single Sign-On in the Enterprise - When you need to authenticate employees for corporate applications hosted in the cloud outside the corporate security boundary, without requiring them to sign in every time they visit an application. This provides a seamless user experience similar to on-premises applications where users authenticate once and gain access to all relevant applications</li>
<li>Federated Identity with Multiple Partners - When you need to authenticate both corporate employees and business partners who do not have accounts in the corporate directory. This is common in business-to-business applications, applications that integrate with third-party services, and scenarios where companies with different IT systems have merged or shared resources</li>
<li>SaaS Applications - For independent software vendors providing a ready-to-use service for multiple clients or tenants. Each tenant can authenticate using a suitable identity provider, such as corporate credentials for business users or social identity credentials for consumers and clients of the tenant</li>
<li>Improving User Experience - When users typically need to work with multiple applications provided and hosted by different organizations, federated identity can simplify the user experience by allowing them to use the same credentials across all applications. This reduces the likelihood of forgotten passwords and provides a more cohesive user experience</li>
<li>Reducing Administrative Overhead - When you want to minimize the administrative overhead of managing user credentials within the application. By delegating authentication to a trusted identity provider, you can simplify development and reduce the need for user administration tasks such as password reminders and account deprovisioning</li>
<li>Enhancing Security - When you need to enhance security by offloading user management and authentication to a trusted identity provider. This can provide advanced capabilities for identity-based threat detection and prevention and ensure that user credentials are managed securely</li>
<li>Supporting Claims-Based Access Control — When you need to implement role-based access control (RBAC) based on role claims contained in the authentication token, this allows for a more granular level of control over access to features and resources within the application.</li>

<p>When implementing the Gateway Offloading pattern, there are several issues and considerations to keep in mind</p>
<ul>
<li>Coupling Across Services - Introducing a gateway can create coupling across services, which might not be suitable for all architectures. This coupling can lead to dependencies that complicate the deployment and scaling of individual services</li>
<li>Single Point of Failure - The gateway itself can become a single point of failure if not properly managed. It is crucial to ensure that the gateway is highly available and resilient to failure by running multiple instances and designing it for the capacity and scaling requirements of the application</li>
<li>Performance Overhead - Offloading functionality to a gateway can introduce performance overhead. The gateway must be designed to handle the additional load without becoming a bottleneck for the application. This includes ensuring that the gateway can scale appropriately to meet the demands of the application</li>
<li>Security Management - Properly handling security issues such as token validation, encryption, and SSL certificate management requires specialized skills. The gateway must be configured and managed by a team with the necessary expertise to ensure that security is not compromised</li>
<li>Administrative Overhead - While offloading shared functionalities to a gateway can reduce administrative overhead in some areas, it can also introduce new administrative tasks. For example, managing and updating SSL certificates or other shared resources at the gateway level requires careful coordination and planning</li>
<li>Consistency in Logging and Monitoring - The gateway can provide consistency in request and response logging and monitoring. However, it is essential to ensure that the gateway is correctly instrumented to provide the necessary level of monitoring and logging, even if individual services are not</li>
<li>Specialized Features - Offloading specialized features such as authentication, authorization, logging, monitoring, or throttling to the gateway allows dedicated teams to manage these features. This can simplify the development and maintenance of the core application but requires coordination between teams to ensure that the offloaded features are correctly implemented and maintained</li>
<li>Business Logic - Business logic should never be offloaded to the gateway. The gateway should only handle cross-cutting concerns that are used by the entire application, such as security or data transfer. Offloading business logic can lead to a tightly coupled architecture that is difficult to maintain and scale. Considering these issues and carefully planning the implementation, you can effectively use the Gateway Offloading pattern to simplify application development, enhance security, and ensure consistency in logging and monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="when-to-use-this-pattern-15">When to use this pattern<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/cloud-design-patterns/#when-to-use-this-pattern-15" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to When to use this pattern" title="Direct link to When to use this pattern">​</a></h5>
<p>The Gateway Offloading pattern should be used in the following scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared or Specialized Service Functionality - When you need to offload shared or specialized service functionality, such as SSL certificate management, authentication, authorization, logging, monitoring, or throttling, to a gateway proxy. This can simplify application development by moving these cross-cutting concerns from other parts of the application into the gateway</li>
<li>Reducing Administrative Overhead - When managing shared features across multiple services increases administrative overhead and the likelihood of deployment errors. Offloading these features to a gateway can reduce the need to configure, manage, and maintain them across all services, simplifying updates and reducing the risk of errors</li>
<li>Centralized Security Management - When you need to handle complex security tasks such as token validation, encryption, and SSL certificate management. Offloading these tasks to a gateway allows dedicated teams with specialized skills to manage them, ensuring that security is not compromised</li>
<li>Consistency in Logging and Monitoring - When you want to ensure consistency in request and response logging and monitoring across services. The gateway can be configured to provide a minimum level of monitoring and logging, even if individual services are not correctly instrumented</li>
<li>High Availability and Resilience - When you need to ensure that the gateway is highly available and resilient to failure. Running multiple instances of the gateway and designing it for the capacity and scaling requirements of the application can help avoid single points of failure and ensure that the gateway does not become a bottleneck</li>
<li>Simplifying Configuration and Management - When you want to simplify the configuration and management of supporting resources, such as web server certificates and secure website configurations. Offloading these responsibilities to a gateway can make service upgrades simpler and more manageable</li>
<li>Specialized Team Management - When you want to allow dedicated teams to implement features that require specialized expertise, such as security. This allows your core team to focus on the application functionality, leaving these specialized but cross-cutting concerns to the relevant experts</li>
<li>Network Security and Attack Mitigation - When you need to mitigate attacks at the edge ensure that internet traffic routes only through the gateway, not directly to the workloads or PaaS services. The gateway should have the ability to mitigate exploits and provide network security. By considering these scenarios, you can determine whether the Gateway Offloading pattern is suitable for your application and ensure that it meets the necessary security, user experience, and administrative requirements.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[This is a step-by-step guide on exporting Azure DevOps repositories to an Azure Storage Account for backup and recovery.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When recently deleted, Azure DevOps code repositories go into a soft-delete state, any repositories deleted are retained for 30 days before they are permanently deleted.</p>
<p>For Disaster Recovery scenarios or scenarios where you may not realize something has been deleted until after Microsoft retains the backup, you may want to export the repositories at a single point in time to an Azure storage account.</p>
<p>The Azure DevOps service is highly redundant and built on core Azure Platform infrastructure components, such as Availability Zones and is built using Azure Cloud native Storage and Azure SQL services, which are highly redundant and backed-up.</p>
<p>However, mistakes can happen, and there may be organizational requirements to retain backups of the repositories.</p>
<p>Today, we will examine exporting your repositories to an Azure Storage Account using a DevOps pipeline. This pipeline will capture the repositories at their current state and run nightly.</p>

<p>Now, it's time to set up your project and repository. If you don't know how to do that, you can follow the official Microsoft Learn documentation here: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/create-new-repo?view=azure-devops&amp;WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create a new Git repo in your project</a>.</p>
<p>Once your repository has been set up and initialized, we need to add the following files.</p>
<h1>💻 PowerShell Script</h1>
<p>The PowerShell script, <code>Export-AzDevOpsRepos.ps1</code>, is responsible for cloning all repositories in a given Azure DevOps organization and downloading them as ZIP files. It uses the Azure DevOps REST API to fetch all projects and their respective repositories. For each repository, it generates a URL to download the repository as a ZIP file and saves it to a local directory. If the script is run in an Azure Pipelines environment, it also uploads the directory containing the downloaded repositories as a pipeline artifact.</p>

<h1>🚀 Azure Pipelines</h1>
<p>The Azure Pipelines configuration file, <code>.azure-pipelines/pipeline.ci.adoexport.yml</code> sets up a CI pipeline that runs the PowerShell script on a schedule. The pipeline is configured to run on the latest Windows agent. It uses the Azure CLI task to run the PowerShell script and to manage access to an Azure storage account. After the script has run, the pipeline downloads any ZIP files produced as artifacts and copies them to the Azure storage account. The pipeline is scheduled to run daily at midnight.</p>

<p>You can also find the latest files in the <a href="https://github.com/lukemurraynz/ADO_Export" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lukemurraynz/ADO_Export</a> GitHub repository. Feel free to open a Pull Request, Suggest changes, or improve.</p>
<p>I am going to be lazy and just drag the files into the repo and commit them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Export_ADO_CommitFiles" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/Export_ADO_CommitFiles-b8ad417e67074d3ae587901f68555ea7.gif" width="1903" height="974" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Once committed, it is time to set up our pipeline.</p>
<p>But first, we need to setup our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=Windows&amp;WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PAT (Personal Access Token)</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&amp;tabs=yaml&amp;WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Service Connection</a>. Both I have completed.</p>
<p>For your PAT token, you will need the following permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code (Read)</li>
<li>Project and Team (Read)</li>
</ul>
<p>For your Service Connection, you will need the following permissions:</p>
<p>Reader on the Subscription that Contains your Storage Account <em>(the subscription scoping is required for the Azure CLI commanders to check and access your Storage account; if you are using a Self-Managed DevOps agent, you may be able to avoid this)</em>, and Storage Blob Data Contributor on the Storage Account.</p>
<p>Then, we need to add to our pipeline the following:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Example</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>azDevOpsOrg</td><td>Contoso</td><td>Your Azure DevOps Org - matching your URL ie (<a href="https://dev.azure.com/contoso" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dev.azure.com/contoso</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>azServiceConnection</td><td>AzureServiceConnection</td><td>Your Service Connection name for Azure Resource Provider access to your Azure Resource Group</td></tr><tr><td>pat</td><td>2xj2jv4yf2h6xvqjgk7y2n4d2iucxltlzyxuhcdjxibnrf</td><td>Your PAT (Personal Access Token), used to authenticate to Azure DevOps. Set this as a secure string.</td></tr><tr><td>stgAccContainer</td><td>adoexport</td><td>The Container that will contain your ADO Exports inside of the Storage Account</td></tr><tr><td>storageAccount</td><td>adoexport23</td><td>Storage account that your ADO exports will be going into.</td></tr><tr><td>storageAccountRG</td><td>adoexport-rg</td><td>Resource Group, containing your Azure Storage Account</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>So, let's import our pipeline and configure our variables!</p>
<ol>
<li>To import the Pipeline, navigate to your Azure DevOps Project, click on Pipelines, and then click on the "New Pipeline" button.</li>
<li>Click Azure Repos Git and select your repository.</li>
<li>Select Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file</li>
<li>Select your Pipeline and click Continue</li>
<li>Now, we can add our Variables by clicking Variables and then Add. If you have already imported the Pipeline, you can navigate to the Pipeline, click Edit, and then Variables.</li>
</ol>

            <description><![CDATA[Deploy large language models on AKS using Kaito, an operator that simplifies the deployment of AI/ML inference models in a Kubernetes cluster.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, we are going to look at deploying a large language model <em>(LLM)</em> directly into your AKS <em>(Azure Kubernetes Service)</em> cluster, running on GPU-enabled nodes, using <a href="https://github.com/Azure/kaito" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaito <em>(Kubernetes AI Toolchain Operator)</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KAITO is an open-source operator that transforms how you deploy AI models on Kubernetes. It streamlines the process, automating critical tasks like infrastructure provisioning and resource optimization. It intelligently selects the optimal hardware configuration for your specific model, using available CPU and GPU resources on AKS. KAITO eliminates the manual setup complexities, accelerating your deployment time and reducing associated costs.</p>

The target models are popular open-sourced inference models such as Falcon and llama2. Kaito has the following critical differentiations compared to most of the mainstream model deployment methodologies built on top of virtual machine infrastructures:</p><ul>
<li>Manage large model files using container images. An HTTP server is provided to perform inference calls using the model library.</li>
<li>Avoid tuning deployment parameters to fit GPU hardware by providing preset configurations.</li>
<li>Auto-provision GPU nodes based on model requirements.</li>
<li>Host large model images in the public Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) if the license allows.</li>
</ul><p>Kaito follows the classic Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition(CRD)/controller design pattern. The user manages a workspace custom resource that describes the GPU requirements and the inference specification. Kaito controllers automate the deployment by reconciling the workspace custom resource.</p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Kaito - Architecture" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/kaito-arch-2e8dc7b883bd663ee34c62f7781cd570.png" width="2666" height="1123" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul>
<li>Workspace controller: It reconciles the workspace custom resource, creates machine custom resources to trigger node auto-provisioning, and creates the inference workload (deployment or stateful set) based on the model preset configurations.</li>
<li>Node provisioner controller: The controller's name is gpu-provisioner in <a href="https://github.com/Azure/kaito/tree/main/charts/kaito/gpu-provisioner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaito helm chart</a>. It uses the machine CRD originated from Karpenter to interact with the workspace controller. It integrates with Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS) APIs to add new GPU nodes to the AKS cluster. Note that the gpu-provisioner is an open-sourced component. It can be replaced by other controllers if they support Karpenter-core APIs.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>At the time of this article, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/public-preview-kubernetes-ai-toolchain-operator-kaito-addon-for-aks/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaito is in preview</a> and <strong>is not recommended for production use</strong>.</p>
</blockquote><p>There are some significant benefits of running open-source LLMs with Kaito. Some advantages include:</p><ul>
<li>Automated GPU node provisioning and configuration: Kaito will automatically provision and configure GPU nodes for you. This can help reduce the operational burden of managing GPU nodes, configuring them for Kubernetes, and tuning model deployment parameters to fit GPU profiles.</li>
<li>Reduced cost: Kaito can help you save money by splitting inferencing across lower-end GPU nodes, which may also be more readily available and cost less than high-end GPU nodes.</li>
<li>Support for popular open-source LLMs: Kaito offers preset configurations for popular open-source LLMs. This can help you deploy and manage open-source LLMs on AKS and integrate them with your intelligent applications.</li>
<li>Fine-grained control: You can fully control data security and privacy, model development and configuration transparency, and fine-tune the model to fit your specific use case.</li>
<li>Network and data security: You can ensure these models are ring-fenced within your organization's network, and the data never leaves the Kubernetes cluster.</li>

<p>Today, we will use the <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-store-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aks store demo—Pets</a> sample microservices app, commonly used for AKS demos, tutorials, and experiments. We will deploy it to our AKS cluster, update it to use a locally hosted mistral model to generate the local product descriptions, and then call the externally hosted Azure OpenAI endpoint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This sample demo app consists of containerized microservices that can be easily deployed into an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. It is meant to show a realistic scenario using a polyglot architecture, event-driven design, and common open-source back-end services <em>(e.g., RabbitMQ, MongoDB)</em>. The application also leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 models to generate product descriptions. This can be done using either Azure OpenAI or OpenAI.</p>

These models, intended to be causal decoder-only models, were trained on a high-quality, varied corpus mostly obtained from online data. Falcon-180B, the largest model in the series, is the only publicly available pretraining run ever, having been trained on a dataset of more than 3.5 trillion text tokens.</p><p>The researchers discovered that Falcon-180B shows great advancements over other models, including PaLM or Chinchilla. It outperforms models being developed concurrently, such as LLaMA 2 or Inflection-1. Falcon-180B achieves performance close to PaLM-2-Large, which is noteworthy given its lower pretraining and inference costs. With this ranking, Falcon-180B joins GPT-4 and PaLM-2-Large as the leading language models in the world. For more information, see the following resources:</p><ul>

<li>Once the registration is complete, we can prepare to deploy the workload identity, workspace, and GPU-enabled node pool for Kaito; as part of this, we need to define the environment variables (if you are still using the Codespace, these should be carried over from the previous deployment; if not, we can set them)*. Adding the variables helps us avoid having to enter the values each time we run a command.</li>

<p>The deployment can take a few minutes <em>(ie 20-50 minutes, the Resources because ready, before the workspace is ready)</em>, so be patient.

It took me 45 minutes when I tested with the Mistral 7b model</p>

<p>Almost there! Now that we know that our local chat endpoint is working with the Falcon 7b instruct model, we can update the Pet Store app to use the local Falcon 7b model and remove the Azure OpenAI to generate the product descriptions.</p>
<p>We will continue in our Terminal to do that, but like the previous steps, it can be done in the Codespace. The Pet Store application already has some great examples of doing this, so we will create a new manifest and repoint the application to use the local Falcon workspace instead of the public Azure Open AI endpoint that was created initially:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we need to create a new config map to deploy the Pet Store app with the Falcon 7b instruct model by running the following command:</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Workloads deployed on an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster require Microsoft Entra application credentials or managed identities to access Microsoft Entra-protected resources, such as Azure Key Vault and Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Entra Workload ID integrates with the capabilities native to Kubernetes to federate with external identity providers.</p>
<p>Let's look at how that might be set up for Managed Identity for AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) in Azure.</p>

</ul></div></div>
<p>So, let us look at adding a Federated Credential to a User Assigned Managed identity.</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Settings</strong> and <strong>Federated credentials</strong></p>
<p>We will look at one I set up earlier. How this is used is application-specific, but in this example, the Federated credentials are used by an AI Service running on an AKS cluster to talk to an Azure OpenAI instance that the User Assigned Managed identity has access to.</p>

<p>First up is:</p>
<p><strong>Cluster Issue URL</strong>, in my example, I have:</p>

<p>So what is this? This is the URL of the OpenID Connect provider with which the AKS cluster is federating. It is also the URL that the AKS cluster will use to authenticate the User Assigned Managed identity.</p>
<p>To get the URL, you can use the Azure CLI and run the following query:</p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">az aks show </span><span class="token parameter variable" style="color:rgb(189, 147, 249);font-style:italic">-n</span><span class="token plain"> myAKScluster </span><span class="token parameter variable" style="color:rgb(189, 147, 249);font-style:italic">-g</span><span class="token plain"> myResourceGroup </span><span class="token parameter variable" style="color:rgb(189, 147, 249);font-style:italic">--query</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">"oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl"</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token parameter variable" style="color:rgb(189, 147, 249);font-style:italic">-otsv</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>To test that it is responding and open, you can navigate to the URL discovery endpoint '/openid/v1/jwks', for example:</p>

<p>However, for the Federated credential configuration for AKS, the OIC URL from the Azure CLI <code>az aks show</code> command is enough.</p>
<p>Second is the <strong>Namespace</strong>. This is the Namespace in which the User Assigned Managed identity will be used. In my example, I have 'pets' as this is my Application namespace. Be as specific as you can.</p>
<p>In Kubernetes, a namespace organizes and isolates resources within a cluster. It acts as a virtual cluster within the main cluster. Namespaces allow you to group related objects (such as pods, services, and deployments) together and provide a scope for resource names.</p>
<p>Third is the <strong>Service Account</strong>. This Service Account will be linked to the Federated credential inside of AKS.</p>
<p>A service account is an identity used by pods (containers) running within a namespace to authenticate with other services or APIs. Each namespace can have multiple service accounts, and they are associated with specific permissions. When a pod is created, it can be assigned a service account. The pod then uses the credentials associated with that service account to access other resources (e.g., secrets, APIs). Service accounts are useful for controlling access and ensuring that pods have the appropriate permissions.</p>
<p>That leaves the <strong>Subject identifier</strong>. This is the Subject identifier.</p>
<p>In AKS Federated credentials, the subject identifier refers to the identity the managed identity will trust. When using workload identity, the subject identifier is typically the service account associated with a pod. The subject identifier establishes trust between the managed identity (related to the AKS cluster) and the service account (associated with the pod). Once this trust is established, the managed identity can securely use the service account’s credentials to access other Azure services.</p>
<p>Namespaces provide isolation, service accounts represent identities for pods, and subject identifiers (usually service accounts) are used in federated credentials to establish trust between the managed identity and Kubernetes workloads.</p>
<p>Under the Credentials details, we have <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Audience</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>name</strong> refers to the identifier associated with a managed identity or service principal in Azure. In AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service), when configuring federated credentials using managed identities, you create a managed identity (or use an existing one) to represent your AKS cluster. This managed identity is assigned a unique name, which is used to identify it within Entra ID. For example, creating a managed identity named “my-aks-cluster-identity” becomes the name associated with the identity.</p>
<p>The <strong>audience</strong> (also known as the “aud” claim) is a critical part of security tokens (such as JWTs) issued by Azure AD. In the context of AKS federated credentials, the audience represents the intended recipient of the token. When a pod in AKS requests an access token (e.g., to access Azure Key Vault secrets), the audience is set to the specific Azure resource (e.g., Key Vault) the pod wants to access. The audience ensures that the token is valid only for the specified resource. For example, if a pod seeks to access a secret stored in Azure Key Vault, the audience in the token will be set to the Key Vault’s endpoint.</p>
<p>The <code>api://AzureADTokenExchange</code> audience is typically used when a service needs to obtain a token to act on behalf of a user or another service. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user logs in to a web application (front-end), and the application needs to call an API (back-end) on behalf of the user. The front-end application requests an on-behalf-of token with the <code>api://AzureADTokenExchange</code> audience.</li>
<li>A service (acting as a middle-tier) receives an access token from a client and needs to call another downstream service.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(e.g., a database or an API)</em>. It exchanges the token for an on-behalf-of token using the same audience.</p>
<p>The api://AzureADTokenExchange audience is used explicitly for token exchange scenarios, allowing services to obtain tokens on behalf of users or other services.</p>
<p>Name: The unique identifier for a managed identity or service principal.
Audience: The intended recipient (Azure resource) for the security token.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have been some changes to the Azure Portal that have people scratching their heads; I am talking about the infamous collapsable Blade menu.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Azure Portal - Collapse Blade Menu" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/Azure_Portal_CollapseableMenu-320e53b992b333fd398c13d7c7e8431e.png" width="424" height="692" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I actually like it because it gives the flexibility to hide areas that you may be potentially distracted by, especially as more and more service functionality is brought into the Azure Portal. However, a concern I have is not being able to see new services or options offered in the blade of a service, so for that reason alone, at the moment, I have configured my Azure Portal to have the Blade menu always open.</p>
<p>You can do this fairly easily per user: click on Settings <em>(top right)</em>, click Appearance + Startup views, select Expanded Service menu behavior, and then click Apply.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Azure Expanded Menu" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/AzurePortal_ExpandedMenuSetting-e37ad96a6d76e876dee1ebb573883726.gif" width="1861" height="965" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>You can also leave it collapsed, then expand the Blade menu of a resource, by clicking on the <em>little</em> expand icon at the top of the Blade menu, to expand or collapse all headers of the resource pane.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Troubleshooting Azure Open AI and API calls to OpenAI can be challenging, especially when you may not know where to start!</p>
<p>The idea of this article is to give you not only a place to start with some common scenarios you may run into but also a way of thinking - to help you troubleshoot. This is not a technical 'get-your-hands dirty, delve into those logs' type article.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of the KT, or <a href="https://kepner-tregoe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kepner-Tregoe</a> problem analysis methodology, and I have used it in many scenarios throughout my career to help discover and test the root cause of various problems. So, we will use the base of this problem analysis methodology to help us troubleshoot the scenarios we will discuss in this article.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Kepner-Tregoe Method" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/KT_Method-265bb6f9d9b479b3cbb62da099a35273.png" width="1856" height="1524" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>You may find that with some issues, we instinctively do a lot of this. Still, this method helps, gives you context, allows you to check any bias you may have in trying to find the root cause, and gives you some great tools to rule out and test any theories, given it has been a few years since I have been through the formal training. Still, it's one of those methodologies that have stuck with me, and I always keep it in mind when troubleshooting issues. Obviously, you can use this methodology for more than just troubleshooting OpenAI issues; this is the scenario we are going to cover today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key to successful troubleshooting, if any IT <em>(Information Technology)</em> issue - is having a clear problem statement, and in the 'real world' really concentrating on the one single problem statement to remain effective for this article; however, we will be covering a mix of common scenarios problems, to help give you high-level ideas and context when troubleshooting issues.</p>

<p>Today, we are going to look at the following statements:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Type of Problem Statement</th><th>Problem Statement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chunking Control</td><td>"Inconsistent accuracy during high-volume transactions suggests that the chunking process is not fully controlled. The problem manifests where API consumption occurs and is especially prominent when handling complex inputs of varying sizes."</td></tr><tr><td>Token Limit Checks</td><td>"Unexpected API call failures, which are confirmed to occur before the API request is made, indicate that the token limit pre-check may not be accurately estimating token sizes, particularly at the time of calling and in cases of complex requests."</td></tr><tr><td>Region Usage</td><td>"Increased latency and occasional service disruptions are observed in a specific default region during peak usage times, suggesting that network latency or regional service performance may not be optimized for the workload, impacting certain regions more than others."</td></tr><tr><td>Model Versioning</td><td>"Encoding and performance issues have arisen across all API endpoints following model or API updates, which are more pronounced in certain versions, indicating that using outdated model versions or incompatibilities between model versions and API might be the underlying cause."</td></tr><tr><td>Streaming Response</td><td>"User experience issues with the streaming implementation on the front-end application during real-time interactions suggest that there might be backend streaming service limitations or insufficient front-end optimization, affecting certain user interactions."</td></tr><tr><td>Token Volume Expectancy</td><td>"The system occasionally experiences overload or underperformance across all API endpoints during 24/7 operation, implying that token volume expectancy might not be accurately predicted or that the system's scaling and load balancing are not adequately configured."</td></tr><tr><td>Logging Practices</td><td>"Issues in diagnostic effectiveness within the logging system arise during error occurrences, which may be due to incomplete logging data or incorrect logging configurations, affecting the resolution of problems by not capturing comprehensive data."</td></tr><tr><td>API Versioning</td><td>"Persisting aborted issues and doubts regarding production readiness after using a preview API version suggest that stability might be compromised due to the continued use of a less stable preview version rather than the GA version across the API service."</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>If you encounter this error, it could be likely that you are using the Azure Function ExtensionBundle, which does not contain the necessary dependencies to query the OpenAI API.</p>
<p>The binding requires at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.OpenAI: 0.12.0-alpha</li>
<li>Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.OpenAI.Kusto: 0.12.0-alpha</li>

<p>When working with Microsoft Azure, you may want an environment for learning, whether for an individual or a team.</p>
<p>Cloud Sandboxes are contained, isolated environments that allow the evaluation of new Cloud services and features (without impacting production environments).</p>

<p>Subscription Vending is the foundation of what we will discuss today: Sandbox vending.</p>
<p>I will base this article on Unmanaged Sandboxes <em>(Subscription-scoped Sandboxes)</em>; however, much of the same information can be used across all Sandbox types.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Sandbox Types" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/Azure_Sandbox_Types-3ca36f3329a48acbf215c3222a060d86.png" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>The scenario we are going to run through today involves creating an <a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/microsoft-azure-sandbox-design-considerations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unmanaged</a> <em>(i.e., subscription-scoped)</em> Sandbox <em>(Sandbox vending)</em> per user or team, which could be a method of implementing it.</p>
<p>To go through this scenario, we will use the following Disciplines of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Adoption</a> to help separate elements.</p>

<p>When working with a Sandbox environment, you need to be aware of the costs associated with it. <a href="https://www.finops.org/framework/principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FinOps principles</a> can be key.</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tags</a> can be key to help you showback/chargeback costs and help you assign resource owners.</p>
<p>Recommended Tags for a Sandbox environment could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>"costCenter": "sandbox"</li>
<li>"costModel": "show-back"</li>
<li>"environment": "sandbox"</li>
<li>"resourceowner": "your_name"</li>
<li>"project": "sandbox_project"</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the Sandbox environment is for learning, you still need to be aware of its associated costs and keep these as lean as possible.</p>
<p>You can also implement Cost Management and Governance workbooks that allow Sandbox users access to interactive dashboards to help them understand their costs and usage.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/finops-toolkit/governance-workbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Governance workbook</a> - Monitor the governance posture of your Azure environment. Leverage recommendations to address compliance issues.</li>

<p>Monthly resource spending should be forecast initially and amended as the footprint changes.</p>
<p>Budget alerts are set up to highlight unplanned spending, not to prevent it <em>(i.e., they are alerting thresholds, not limits)</em>.</p>
<p>Each Sandbox environment could start with a consistent Budget and can be adjusted IF required as an exception.
Budgets are intended to drive Sandbox owners to keep their costs under control by having the information on hand.</p>

<p>Security is a key concern for any environment, and the Sandbox environment is no different; however, there are some tradeoffs. The key to a successful Sandbox environment is that it's an environment for learning, so the level of security you would adopt should be less. However, there are some stop gaps that should be implemented.</p>

<p>Defender for Cloud should be enabled on all Sandboxes to help protect against threats and increase visibility. It is a great learning tool.</p>
<p>As people learn how to use Azure technologies, they may not necessarily know how to secure them or how their services might be adapted for a more secure environment.

<p>There are tradeoffs with the type of Azure policies you deploy in a Sandbox environment vs what you would deploy in your Production or even Dev/Test environment; recommended policies as a base I would recommend are:</p>

<p>The Decommissioned Management group is where you would move your Sandbox subscriptions once they are no longer required and you want to decommission them.</p>

<p>Key policies are part of the ALZ Sandbox Guardrails, which are essentially the policies to restrict the deployment of network resources. These policies would allow you to link virtual networks to on-premises, peer-to-peer virtual networks and allow Sandbox users to connect to production virtual networks or virtual networks outside your organization's control.</p>

<p>Make sure you don't forget about the People/Processes of your sandbox. You should implement Terms of Use for the Sandbox environment so that users understand the rules and regulations of the environment, such as 'Do not store Production data'.</p>
<p>You can combine this directly into the Azure Portal login experience by using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/terms-of-use?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Entra terms of use</a>.</p>

<p>Resource Consistency is key. It ensures that resources are configured consistently to manage onboarding, drift, discoverability, and recovery risks.</p>
<p>This is where a lot of automation comes into play to prevent drift and inconsistencies in creating (and decommissioning) a Sandbox environment.</p>

<p>Ideally, you would have a user interface where a user could request a Sandbox environment <em>(I will talk more about this in the deployment acceleration section)</em>, which would trigger an Azure DevOps pipeline or GitHub action, as an example, to create the environment.</p>
<p>Using Infrastructure as Code <em>(IaC)</em>, you can ensure that the environment is consistent and repeatable and can be provisioned and decommissioned.</p>

<p>EPAC is designed for organizations with a large number of Policies, Policy Sets, and Assignments. It is also designed for organizations with multiple tenants and/or environments. The solution primarily consists of PowerShell scripts intended to run operations such as policy planning, deployment, and sync of external policies, such as Enterprise Landing Zone policies, into the EPAC repo.</p>
<p>Enterprise Policy as Code can also be used to control exemptions. An example is running this nightly; any policies or exemptions not in the repository are removed.</p>
<p>Enterprise Policy as Code could be used for Sandbox environments, providing an opportunity to clean up outdated policies, assignments, and exemptions and maintain consistency.</p>

<p>A large part of the Sandbox vending is a DevOps pipeline and connectivity to Azure that allows Terraform and the pipeline in Azure DevOps to connect to make changes in Azure. Terraform is the car, and Symphony is the road that it travels on.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/symphony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symphony</a> is a framework and set of patterns and best practices for developing, testing, and deploying infrastructure on Azure using Infrastructure as Code <em>(IAC)</em> It includes modern DevOps practices for IAC such as Main and Pull Request workflows, IaC Code Validation &amp; Linting, Automated Testing, Security Scanning, Multi-environment deployments, modules dependencies and more. A mature workflow for IAC not only automates the deployment of the IAC resources but also incorporates engineering fundamentals, resource validation, dependency management, test execution, security scanning, and more.</p>
<p>The Symphony pipelines for Azure DevOps and Terraform, for example, are:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Pipeline Name</th><th>Comments</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>pipeline.ci.terraform.yml</td><td>This YAML file defines a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for Azure DevOps, which triggers changes to the main branch, sets up certain variables, and executes several stages, including validation of configuration and preview deployment using Terraform templates. This file is the command file, triggering the other pipelines.</td></tr><tr><td>pipeline.destroy.terraform.yml</td><td>This YAML file defines a pipeline in Azure DevOps that uses a specific agent image to run a job based on a template for destroying a Terraform environment, with the environment details and key vault information passed as parameters. The pipeline does not trigger automatically on any branch or pull request changes.</td></tr><tr><td>template.terraform.previewdeploy.yml</td><td>This YAML file defines a job in an Azure DevOps pipeline that sets up a clean workspace, installs Terraform and Go, retrieves secrets from an Azure Key Vault, updates network rules and storage account settings, and executes a Terraform plan and apply operation. It also cleans up by removing the agent IP from the Key Vault and denying public access to the Terraform DevOps Storage after the job is done.</td></tr><tr><td>template.terraform.report.yml</td><td>This YAML file defines a job in an Azure DevOps pipeline that, depending on a condition, cleans the workspace, retrieves secrets from an Azure Key Vault, and executes a bash script to backup the state files of a specified environment using Terraform.</td></tr><tr><td>template.terraform.test.yml</td><td>This YAML file defines an end-to-end test job in an Azure DevOps pipeline that sets up a clean workspace, installs Terraform and Go, retrieves secrets from an Azure Key Vault, adds the agent IP to the Key Vault and storage account, runs tests, publishes the test results, and finally removes the agent IP from the Key Vault and storage account.</td></tr><tr><td>template.terraform.validate.yml</td><td>This YAML file defines a validation job in an Azure DevOps pipeline that sets up a clean workspace, installs necessary tools, runs GitLeaks for code analysis, adds the agent IP to a Key Vault, runs Terraform lint and validate, optionally runs layer tests, publishes test results, and finally removes the agent IP from the Key Vault and denies public access to the Terraform DevOps Storage.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Using a framework such as Symphony gives you a good starting point for your deployments.</p>

Both are declarative, meaning you define the desired state of your infrastructure and the tool figures out how to make it so. Bicep is more focused on Microsoft Azure, while Terraform is more focused on multi-cloud.</p>
<p>For this article, I will focus on Terraform, based purely on work done with it around Sandbox provisioning and decommissioning. The Terraform state file helps with a lot of the Sandbox decommissioning aspect.</p>
<p>Terraform modules that can be used during Sandbox provisioning are:</p>

<p>The real foundation of Sandbox vending is the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-lz-vending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure/terraform-azurerm-lz-vending</a> Terraform module.</p>
<p>It can be used to create Azure resources according to the landing zone <em>(Sandbox)</em> vending pattern. It can be used to provision resources such as subscriptions, management group associations, role assignments, and virtual networks.</p>
<p>Here is an example <em>(partial snippet of an overall solution)</em> of how you COULD use the module by having multiple YAML files per Sandbox and using a for_each loop to create each Sandbox environment:</p>

<p>This is a very basic example, but it gives you an idea of how you could use the module to create a Subscription and Resource Group and define Contributor access based on data from a data map that looks at each YAML file in a folder. The Expiry date is used as part of the Sandbox decommissioning process and also added as a Tag to the Subscription, along with the Owner, which can also be used as an email recipient of a Budget.</p>

<p>Using this method, you can create a new Sandbox environment by creating a new YAML file, running the Terraform apply command, and decommissioning the environment by removing the YAML file and running the Terraform apply command again.</p>
<p>For the decommissioning, you can run a separate pipeline to check the expiry of the YAML file, then delete it if it's past its due date, which could then trigger the removal.</p>

<p>To connect to your Sandbox environment, you need to ensure that you have the correct Identity Baseline in place.</p>
<p>I recommend you merge your Sandbox identity access, i.e. Entra ID Groups, Access packages, etc., into your IaC pipelines so that access is granted automatically when a new Sandbox environment is created and removed when no longer required.</p>

<p>With an access package, an administrator or delegated access package manager lists the resources (groups, apps, and sites), and the roles the users need for those resources.
Access packages also include one or more policies. A policy defines the rules or guardrails for assigning access to an access package. Each policy can be used to ensure that only the appropriate users can have access to assignments. Access is time-limited and will expire if not renewed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Access Packages" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/Azure_Sandbox_IAM_AccessPackages-58def0c07c76fe116fd7faea813d5c17.png" width="4000" height="2250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>You can use Access packages to grant access to your Sandbox environment and then remove access when the environment is no longer required.</p>
<p>Access Packages can be used to delegate access to each Sandbox environment to its owner. This allows Sandbox owners, who may have financial delegation, to control who has access to their environment and remove that access when no longer required.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[This article provides a guide on how to change the timezone of your Azure Container App. It includes reasons why you might need to do this, a step-by-step process, and references for further reading.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updating the timezone of your Azure Container Apps containers might not be a common operation, but there are scenarios where it could be necessary.</p>
<p>Example scenarios on why you may want to update the Timezone (from UTC) to another timezone may be because of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application requirements</li>
<li>Logging and debugging concerns</li>
<li>Compliance and regulations
Or general application testing and development</li>
</ul>
<p>You could have this built into the container itself, which would be preferred to keep a consistent experience and to work with any time offset that may be needed (daylight savings, etc), but you can update the container environment.</p>
<p>📺 To demo this, I am using a Container App Environment and a Container App using the 'Simple hello world container' quickstart image.</p>
<p>My revision mode is set to Single; however, the same steps can be applied with multiple revision modes. Just ensure you test and update the right revision or the date change may not be applied.</p>
<p>To update the timezone, we will be the 'TZ' Environment variable, and this change will trigger a new Revision.</p>
<p>First, let us check the current timezone of the container app by running the following command <em>(on a running Container App)</em> from the Console:</p>
<div class="language-PowerShell language-powershell codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-powershell codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">    date</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Check Time/date" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/Update_AzContainerAppTimeZone-Before-95e71d7e58d2ecfc9f2acce713268128.gif" width="1820" height="964" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This will return the current date and time in UTC.</p>
<p>Now, let us update the Timezone. To do that, we need to specify the timezone in the TZ database format; to find this format, we can use sites like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a> or <a href="https://timezone.mariushosting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mariushosting Docker Time Zone (TZ)</a>, as I am based in New Zealand, I will be using: Pacific/Auckland.</p>

<p>To understand why we might need Container Apps, we need to go back to some of the elements of software development.</p>
<p>Containers can be a valuable tool for deploying and managing microservices, but they are not always necessary. Let's explore why you may not need containers for microservices and how they can generally help.</p>
<p>Microservices architecture is a software development approach where an application is built as a collection of small, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with other microservices through well-defined APIs.</p>
<div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info admonition_xJq3 alert alert--info"><div class="admonitionHeading_Gvgb"><span class="admonitionIcon_Rf37"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_BuS1"><p>While containers are not always necessary for deploying microservices, they offer benefits such as isolation, portability, scalability, and deployment consistency. Evaluating your specific requirements, existing infrastructure, and resource constraints will help determine whether containers are the right choice for your microservices architecture, and is intended to help you understand how it could be used, especially around some of the Cloud Native integration components.</p></div></div>
<p><strong>Why you may not need containers for microservices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity: If your microservices are developed using a single programming language or framework and can be easily deployed on traditional servers or virtual machines, containers may not be necessary. In such cases, deploying microservices directly on servers or virtual machines can be simpler and more straightforward.</li>
<li>Existing Infrastructure: If you already have a well-established infrastructure with efficient deployment processes and tools in place, containers may not be required. Leveraging your existing infrastructure can save time and effort in adopting and managing container technologies.</li>
<li>Resource Constraints: Containers introduce additional overhead in terms of resource utilization. If you have limited resources or strict resource constraints, deploying microservices directly on servers or virtual machines may be more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>However, how containers can generally help with microservices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Isolation: Containers provide a lightweight and isolated runtime environment for each microservice. This isolation ensures that changes or issues in one microservice do not affect others, improving overall system stability.</li>
<li>Portability: Containers encapsulate the dependencies and runtime environment required by a microservice, making it highly portable. Microservices packaged as containers can be easily deployed and run on different platforms, such as local development machines, cloud environments, or on-premises servers.</li>
<li>Scalability: Containers enable easy scaling of microservices. With container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, you can dynamically scale the number of containers running a specific microservice based on demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization.</li>
<li>Deployment Consistency: Containers provide a consistent deployment model, ensuring that the microservice runs the same way across different environments. This consistency simplifies the deployment process and reduces the chances of configuration-related issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, let's take a look at Monoliths.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-monoliths">🏢 Monoliths<a href="https://luke.geek.nz/azure/azure-container-apps-overview/#-monoliths" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🏢 Monoliths" title="Direct link to 🏢 Monoliths">​</a></h4>

<p>"In software engineering, a monolithic application is a single unified software application that is self-contained and independent from other applications but typically lacks flexibility"—Wikipedia.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Monolith shortcomings" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/ACA_Overview_Monolith_Shortcomings-0852c45a008051947c103f82e9761333.PNG" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Generally, monolithic architectures suffer from drawbacks that can delay application development and deployment. These drawbacks become especially significant when the product's complexity increases or when the development team grows in size.</p>
<p>The codebase of monolithic applications can be difficult to understand because it may be extensive. This can make it difficult for new developers to modify the code to meet changing business or technical requirements.</p>
<p>As requirements evolve or become more complex, it becomes difficult to correctly implement changes without hampering the code's quality and affecting the application's overall operation.</p>

<p>At its core, the concept of the microservices architecture is an approach to application development in which a large application is built as a collection of modular and cooperating services.</p>
<p>However, in order to successfully achieve a robust microservices architecture, the underlying infrastructure must also be correctly designed. In fact, due to the distributed nature of the microservices architecture, the line between what used to be separate application details and implementation details grows blurrier.</p>
<p>Containers simplify the continuous deployment of microservices.</p>

<p><strong>So, let's take a look at how Microservices and Containers can work together.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s delve into the differences between&nbsp;microservices&nbsp;and&nbsp;containers:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Microservices</th><th>Containers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Definition</td><td>Microservices are an architectural style that breaks down an application into small, autonomous services. These services communicate via well-defined interfaces using lightweight APIs.</td><td>A container is a technology that bundles an application along with all its dependencies into a package. This package allows the application to be deployed consistently across different environments, abstracting away differences in operating systems and underlying infrastructure.</td></tr><tr><td>Structure</td><td>Microservices are self-contained and encapsulate their logic. They interact through well-defined interfaces, allowing independent development and deployment.</td><td>Containers ride on a host operating system, similar to virtual machines (VMs), but they share the OS kernel. This makes them lighter and faster to boot than VMs. Containers are hosted on a container runtime, which enables multiple containers (each several megabytes in size) to run on a single server.</td></tr><tr><td>Popular Tools</td><td>Microservices can be developed with various programming languages and frameworks.</td><td>Docker is a well-known commercial container management solution, while Kubernetes (often referred to as K8s) is a widely used free and open-source container management system.</td></tr><tr><td>Pros</td><td>Enhance maintainability, testability, and scalability. Organized around business capabilities and are typically owned by small teams.</td><td>Excellent for packaging and deploying applications consistently, regardless of the environment. More lightweight and faster to boot than VMs.</td></tr><tr><td>Cons</td><td>Complexity in managing multiple services. Need for coordination and communication between services.</td><td>Requires knowledge of container management and orchestration tools. Potential security risks if not properly isolated.</td></tr><tr><td>Use Case</td><td>Suitable for building modular, scalable applications.</td><td>Provides the infrastructure for running microservices, ensuring consistent deployment and management across different environments.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><strong>So, what is Container orchestration?</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Container orchastration" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/ACA_Overview_WhatisContainerOrchastration-963aa3154bb30dbbd3198166a652e57e.gif" width="1905" height="964" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Container orchestration&nbsp;plays a crucial role in managing and scaling containerized applications. Here are some reasons why it’s essential:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Scaling and Load Balancing</td><td>Container orchestration tools like Kubernetes allow you to dynamically scale your application by adding or removing containers based on demand. Load balancing ensures that incoming requests are distributed evenly across containers, preventing overload on any single instance.</td></tr><tr><td>High Availability</td><td>Orchestration ensures that your application remains available even if individual containers fail. It automatically restarts failed containers or replaces them with healthy ones.</td></tr><tr><td>Service Discovery and DNS</td><td>Containers come and go, making it challenging to keep track of their IP addresses. Orchestration tools provide service discovery and DNS resolution, allowing containers to find each other by name.</td></tr><tr><td>Rolling Updates and Rollbacks</td><td>When deploying new versions of your application, orchestration allows for rolling updates. You can gradually replace old containers with new ones, minimizing downtime. In case of issues, you can easily roll back to a previous version.</td></tr><tr><td>Configuration Management</td><td>Orchestration tools manage environment variables, secrets, and other configuration settings for containers. This centralizes configuration management and ensures consistency.</td></tr><tr><td>Resource Optimization</td><td>Orchestration optimizes resource utilization by scheduling containers efficiently across nodes. It balances CPU, memory, and storage requirements.</td></tr><tr><td>Networking and Security</td><td>Orchestration handles networking, including creating virtual networks for communication between containers. It also manages security policies, access controls, and network segmentation.</td></tr><tr><td>Monitoring and Logging</td><td>Container orchestration platforms provide monitoring dashboards and logs. You can track performance, troubleshoot issues, and gain insights into your application.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Azure Container Apps is built on a foundation of powerful open-source technology to deliver the same microservices benefits as Kubernetes as a fully managed and serverless app hosting option. Behind the scenes, every container app runs on Azure Kubernetes Service, with Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA), Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr), and Envoy deeply integrated in the hosting service. However, developers and operators are not exposed to this underlying Kubernetes infrastructure. The open-source-centric approach enables a path for teams to build microservices without having to overcome the concept and operational overhead of working with Kubernetes directly and enables continued app portability by leveraging open standards and APIs</p>

A revision is an immutable snapshot of a container app version.</p></div></div>
<p>The first revision is automatically provisioned when you deploy your container app.
New revisions are automatically provisioned when you make a&nbsp;revision-scope&nbsp;change to your container app.
While revisions are immutable, they're affected by&nbsp;application-scope&nbsp;changes, which apply to all revisions.
You can create new revisions by updating a previous revision.
You can retain up to 100 revisions, giving you a historical record of your container app updates.
You can run multiple revisions concurrently.
You can split external HTTP traffic between active revisions.</p>

<p>It's worth noting how your Containers will shut down as Azure Container Apps scales your Apps or you deactivate a revision, as this can affect your application.</p>
<p>The containers are shut down in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a container app scales in</li>
<li>As a container app is being deleted</li>
<li>As a revision is being deactivated</li>
</ul>
<p>When a shutdown is initiated, the container host sends a SIGTERM message to your container. The code implemented in the container can respond to this operating system-level message to handle termination.</p>
<p>If your application doesn't respond within 30 seconds to the SIGTERM message, then SIGKILL terminates your container.</p>
<p>Additionally, make sure your application can gracefully handle shutdowns. Containers restart regularly, so don't expect the state to persist inside a container. Instead, use external caches for expensive in-memory cache requirements.</p>

Born at Microsoft in 2019 as an incubation project, it was donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2021 and is now a highly successful open-source project. Dapr helps you write flexible and secure microservices that leverage industry-proven best practices to build connected distributed applications faster. By letting Dapr’s sidecar take care of the complex challenges such as service discovery, message broker integration, encryption, observability, and secret management, you can focus on business logic and keep your code simple.</p></div></div>
<p>Dapr is a set of integrated APIs with built-in best practices and patterns to build distributed applications. Dapr increases your developer productivity by 20-40% with out-of-the-box features such as workflow, pub/sub, state management, secret stores, external configuration, bindings, actors, distributed lock, and cryptography. You benefit from the built-in security, reliability, and observability capabilities, so you don't need to write boilerplate code to achieve production-ready applications.
Dapr's component model decouples the integrated API with the underlying resources. For instance, when you're using the Dapr publish-subscribe API, you can change the message broker by swapping out a yaml component file to switch from RabbitMQ to Kafka (or any other supported broker) without changing your application code.</p>

<p><strong>Accessibility levels</strong></p>
<p>Using internal and external accessibility levels, you can configure whether your container app allows public ingress or ingress only from within your VNet at the environment level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Azure Container Apps - Accessibility levels" src="https://luke.geek.nz/assets/images/ACA_Overview_NetworkAccessibilitylevels-7f9007f566651c94cb6c726b80fa90c9.PNG" width="1280" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Custom VNET (Virtual Network) integration</p>
<p>If you want your container app to restrict all outside access, create an&nbsp;internal Container app environment.</p>
<p>When you provide your own VNet, you need to provide a subnet that is dedicated to the Container App environment you deploy. This subnet isn't available to other services.</p>
<p>Network addresses are assigned from a subnet range you define as the environment is created.</p>
<p>You can define the subnet range used by the Container Apps environment.</p>
<p>You can restrict inbound requests to the environment exclusively to the VNet by deploying the environment internally.</p>
<p><strong>User-defined routes</strong></p>
<p>User-defined routes (UDR) and controlled egress through NAT Gateway are supported in the workload profiles environment. These features aren't supported in the consumption-only environment.</p>

<p><strong>Envoy</strong></p>
<p>Azure Container Apps uses <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Envoy proxy</a> <em>(also part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation)</em> as an edge HTTP proxy. TLS is terminated on the edge, and requests are routed based on their traffic splitting rules, which route traffic to the correct application.</p>
<p>Azure Container Apps uses Envoy as a network proxy for all HTTP requests. Envoy provides some capabilities such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling to zero: Envoy allows your container apps to scale to zero instances when there is no traffic and scale up when there is demand. Envoy acts as a buffer between the clients and the container apps and handles the cold start latency.</li>
<li>HTTPS redirection: Envoy automatically redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS, ensuring secure communication between the clients and the container apps.</li>
<li>TLS termination: Envoy terminates the transport layer security (TLS) at the edge of the container app environment and forwards the requests to the container apps over plain HTTP. This reduces the overhead of encryption and decryption for the container apps.</li>
<li>Mutual TLS: Envoy supports mutual TLS (mTLS) when you use Dapr as a sidecar for your container apps. mTLS provides an additional layer of security by requiring both the client and the server to present valid certificates for authentication.</li>
<li>Ingress controls: Envoy allows you to configure some ingress controls for your container apps, such as IP restrictions, CORS, WAF, etc.</li>
</ul>
